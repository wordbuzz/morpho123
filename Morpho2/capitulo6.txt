The structure of coordinate constructions
	
	- tree: Coordinations, coordinates, and coordinators (bare coordinate vs expanded coordinate)
	
		- Coordination as a non-headed construction
	
		- syndectic vs asyndectic

	
	- Layered coordination (Kim and either Pat or Alex)

Some interesting effects of coordination in Meaning


	Clausal and subclausal coordination
	[14] i  a. There is a copy [on the desk and in the top drawer].
		b.They arrived [on [Tuesday or Wednesday]. [subclausal]
		c. He told me [who she was but not what she wanted ].
	     ii a. There is a copy on the desk and there is a copy in the top drawer.
		b.They arrived on Tuesday or they arrived on Wednesday. [clausal]
		c. He told me who she was but he didn’t tell me what she wanted
	
	[15] i One candidate was [very young and very energetic]. [subclausal]
	     ii One candidate was very young and one candidate was very energetic. [clausal
	
	Joint coordination (Kim and Pat are a happy couple
	[17] i Kim and Pat know Greek. [distributive]
	     ii Kim and Pat are a happy couple. [joint]	

	
	
Ambiguity between distributive and joint coordination

Constituent structure and scope ambiguities
Order of coordinates
	Reversible and irreversible coordination
	Lexicalised coordinations
Properties of prototypical coordinators
	Unlimited number of coordinates
	Coordinates must be syntactically alike
	Wide range of categories that can be coordinated

Coordination that is pragmatically comparable to subordination (CGEL 1479 ex 49)
