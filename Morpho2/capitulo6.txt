Cap√≠tulo 6

The structure of coordinate constructions
	Coordinations, coordinates, and coordinators
	Coordination as a non-headed construction
	Contrasting structures
	Place of coordinators in the constituent structure
	Bare and expanded coordinates
Layered coordination (Kim and either Pat or Alex)
Syntactic constituency and semantic scope
	Clausal and subclausal coordination
	Joint coordination (Kim and Pat are a happy couple
	Ambiguity between distributive and joint coordination
Constituent structure and scope ambiguities
Order of coordinates
	Reversible and irreversible coordination
	Lexicalised coordinations
Properties of prototypical coordinators
	Unlimited number of coordinates
	Coordinates must be syntactically alike
	Wide range of categories that can be coordinated

Coordination that is pragmatically comparable to subordination (CGEL 1479 ex 49)
