In English, the prepositions "to" and "for" are commonly used when indicating the recipient or beneficiary of an action. Here are some examples of how "to" and "for" can be used in the context of indirect objects (IO):


"To" in IO:


She gave the book to her sister.
He showed the magic trick to his friends.
She told the story to her children.
They sent the postcard to their parents.
He wrote a love letter to his girlfriend.
The company offered a bonus to their employees.
The waiter served a delicious meal to the customers.
She bought a gift for her husband.
He lent some money to his friend.
The professor taught a difficult concept to his students.
"For" in IO:


She bought a book for her sister.
He prepared a magic trick for his friends.
She wrote a story for her children.
They bought a postcard for their parents.
He wrote a love letter for his girlfriend.
The company arranged a bonus for their employees.
The chef cooked a delicious meal for the customers.
She bought a gift for her husband.
He lent some money for his friend.
The professor prepared a difficult concept for his students.
Note that while "to" and "for" can both be used to indicate the recipient or beneficiary, there may be slight differences in meaning or emphasis depending on the specific context. It's essential to consider the overall context and intention of the sentence when choosing between "to" and "for" in the indirect object position

CAPITULO 9  - Verbos e Sintagmas verbais (formação de verbos; flexão de verbos; tipos de predicados)
CAPITULO 10 - Nomes e Sintagmas nominais (formação de nomes; flexão; contáveis vs não contáveis, estrutura dos NPs a direita) 


There is a lot of controversy in the literature concerning the structure of noun
phrases, particularly in determining the number and type of functional projections
dominating the NP. Traditionally noun phrases were analysed as maximal projections of a lexical head N0
, as represented in (1).
(8) NP
Det N′
N Compl
Investigation of the symmetry between clausal and nominal domains has led researchers to the conclusion that NPs are, like VPs, dominated by functional projections. Thus, Abney (1987) proposes that noun phrases are maximal projections
of D, the position where articles are inserted, and assumes the following structure:
(9) DP
(Poss) D′
D NP
On this approach, the function of the determiner is to specify the reference of
the noun phrase by picking out a particular member of the noun’s extension. This
parallels the function of Infl in the verbal domain, where tense locates a particular
event in time. The DP-analysis of noun phrases was further used to account for
certain cooccurrence restrictions. For instance, the fact that determiners cannot
cooccur with pronominal possessives in English follows on the assumption that
they are all heads and occupy the same syntactic position, namely D0
. D was also
argued to host the possessive morpheme ’s, which takes the possessor DP as its
specifier. This directly captures the ill-formedness of the following examples:
(10) a. *this Peter’s article
b. *the his article
c. *that the article
One of the strongest arguments in favour of the DP-hypothesis was the behaviour
of gerundive nominals in English, such as the one below (from Abney, 1987):


(11) John’s building a spaceship
English gerundive nominals show properties of both nominal and verbal phrases.
They have the distribution of noun phrases, but internally they show verbal characteristics, for example, taking nominal complements, aspectual auxiliaries, and
allowing adverbial modification. The mixed behaviour of gerundive nominals was
captured by assuming the structure in (12), where the functional category D takes
a VP as its complement.
(12) DP
John D′
D
’s
VP
V
building
DP
a spaceship
Since Abney’s influential proposal, much work was devoted to establishing
the validity of the DP-hypothesis. Bringing cross-linguistic data into consideration, particularly strong support was provided by the presence of overt raising of
N to D in some languages. Longobardi (1994), investigating the distribution of
determiners and proper names in Italian, notes that adjectives can either precede
or follow the proper name when the determiner is present, but when it is lacking
the adjectives must follow the noun. On the other hand, in English adjectives must
always precede the proper name. The contrast is illustrated below.
(13) a. (i) E
is
venuto
come
il
the
vecchio
old
Cameresi.
Cameresi
‘The old Cameresi has come.’
(ii) *E venuto vecchio Cameresi.
(iii) E venuto Cameresi vecchio.
b. (i) Old Peter has come.
(ii) *Peter old has come.
Longobardi (1994) accounts for the observed contrast by assuming that in Italian
proper names may move to D by Spellout. If they fail to do so, an expletive
article is inserted in D, and the proper name moves to D in LF. On the other
hand, in English N raising takes place only in LF, in accordance with the Principle
Procrastinate.
Following Abney (1987), Corver postulates the existence of a DP functional layer dominating noun phrases in languages with overt articles. However, unlike Abney who takes NP to be a complement of A, Corver adjoins AP to NP. Thus, the structure he is adopting for English is the following: (78) [VP V [DP Spec [D′D [NP AP [NP N PP]]]]] Assuming that LBE is an instance of phrasal movement, the impossibility of moving a determiner in English stems from the structure preserving condition- determiners such as which and the being X-zero categories cannot be moved to SpecCP, which allows only maximal projections. On the other hand, fronting a prenominal possessor like whose or John’s is prohibited as it would involve the extraction of a non-constituent, assuming that the following configurations are valid for English: (79) a. [DP John [D′ ’s [NP car]]] b. [DP who [D′se [NP car]]] Finally, the extraction of prenominal attributive APs is disallowed as it yields an ECP violation. The proposed analysis builds on Chomsky’s (1986) ECP account of the that-trace effect. The two constructions clearly resemble each other, as illustrated in (80). A that-trace effect configuration involves the extraction of a left branch subject NP from within an embedded CP. If the COMP-position is lexically filled, the removal of the subject will yield an ungrammatical sentence. In a similar fashion, the extraction of a left branch NP constituent is blocked by the presence of D. (80) a. *[DP APi [D′D [NP ti [NP [N′N ]]]]] b. *[CP whoi [C ′ that [IP ti [I ′ I ]]]] The impossibility of extracting attributive adjective phrases is then accounted for in terms of the ECP. The ECP requires traces to be properly governed, which implies either lexical government or antecedent government.19 Since adjectival phrases are adjuncts and thus never lexically governed, the proper government of adjectival traces will crucially depend on the availability of a local antecedent. The government relation can be blocked by two types of barriers: (i) Barriers created by the absence of L-marking (L-barriers), or (ii) Barriers created by the presence of a closer governor (M(inimality)-barriers). M-barriers are defined as follows: (81) A is a M-barrier for B if A includes B, D (an X0 i-commander of B), and G (a maximal projection not necessarily distinct from A), where D i(mmediate)-commands B if the first constituent containing D contains A. Given these assumptions, AP cannot antecedent govern its trace in (80-a) because a minimality barrier D′ intervenes. This category contains a trace, a maximal projection containing the trace, that is NP, and a head i-commanding the trace, D0 . Thus moving an adjective phrase out of an NP will always result in an ECP violation. Notice however, that there is an important difference between an adjectival LBE and a that-trace effect configuration. The examples below illustrate that adjectival LBE is prohibited even when the article is not overt. On the other hand, the omission of that renders the sentence grammatical. (82) a. *Talkativei he hates [DP ti D [NP ti [NP guests]]] b. *Talkativei he hates [DP ti the [NP ti [NP guests]]] c. Whoi do you think [CP ti C [IP ti saw Bill]]? d. *Whoi do you think [CP ti that [IP ti saw Bill]]? Therefore, in order to capture the fact that both (82-a) and (82-b) are ill-formed, Corver needs to assume that both overt and null D project a minimality barrier.


CAPITULO 11 - Preposições e Sintagmas preposicionados


Although all words traditionally classified as prepositions are classified as prepositions in our treatment too, we recognise a good number of other prepositions, formerly classified as adverbs, or as 'subordinating conjunctions'.


It is a closed group.

Prepositions vs subordinators


Traditional subordinators


Two words with the shape if: conditional meaning; interrogative clauses.


Also Preps -  After                 before         till                 until                 since
Reassigned to Preps - Although         because         if 1                lest                 provided         though  unless
Subordinators -     If2                that                 whether


That, whether and if = markers of subordination; the other words in function as heads of the constituents they introduce. 


I think [(that) she 's probably right].
I don 't know [whether they have received our letter yet].
She stayed [after [the others had left]].    adjunct of time 
They complained [because [we didn’t finish the job this week]]. adjunct of reason




Prepositions vs adverbs


Prepositions with optional NP complements
Can occur either with an NP complement or without a complement. 


aboard         above                beneath         beyond         over                 past
across         after                 along                by                 down                in
behind         below        off                 outside        round         since 
through         under         up


They are traditionally analyzed as prepositions when they have an NP complement but as adverbs when they have no complement.


She went aboard the liner.                She went aboard.
He sat outside her bedroom.                He sat outside.


traditional adverb category = wastebasket


TG definition of adverbs category: 'An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb.’ 


DEPENDENT OF NOUN                         DEPENDENT OF VERB         
the conditions aboard                        She went aboard.                
the temperature outside                        He sat outside
Adverbs do not normally occur as dependents of nouns: no such restriction applies to prepositions. 


PP                                                ADVERB
Verb        She criticized them with tact.                She criticized them tactfully.
Noun        [A manager with tact] is needed.        *[A manager tactfully] is needed.                
COMPLEMENT OF BE
She is still aboard.
He is outside.


Adverbs cannot normally function as complement to be in its ascriptive sense.


PP AS COMPLEMENT OF BE                ADVP AS COMPLEMENT OF BE
The key is under the mat.                *Lucy was enthusiastically today
The meeting is on Tuesday.                *Rain is again.


CONCLUSION >> The classification of words like aboard and outside as adverbs is thus inconsistent with the traditional definition of that category. 


This revision simultaneously gets rid of the complication of a dual classification for these words and removes from the adverb class words which differ radically in their syntactic properties from genuine adverbs.


More restricted class of adverbs = all functions that can be filled by adverbs accept some of the most central type (adjectives + ·ly)
First to put forward: 1924 Otto Jespersen
Adopted in linguistics since the 1970s.


Pre Position >> word placed in front of another word (TG word placed in front
of a noun).


BUT
What are you looking for? 
Adverb >> word dependent on a verb (adverbs modify adjectives and other adverbs)


Further extensions of the preposition category


Reassign to this category a number of other words that are traditionally analyzed as adverbs. 


i (occur without complements) abroad         downstairs                 here           outdoors         overboard overseas there 
ii (take complements with the form of PPs) ahead because instead


DEPENDENT OF NOUN
You can use [the office downstairs].
[Water instead of wine] won't do!


COMPLEMENT OF BE
The spare chairs are downstairs.
This is instead of your usual lunch.


Further category contrasts


Prepositions and nouns are too obvious to merit further discussion.


Prepositions vs adjectives


* NP complements
Prototypical preposition class license NP complements. 
Adjectives do not.


* Inflection and gradability
Prototypical adjectives inflect for grade or else have comparatives and superlatives marked by the modifiers more and most. 
Prepositions, by contrast, are normally non-gradable. 
specialized meanings do permit certain kinds of grading:
You 're more at home with trigonometry than I am:
Feel more in control of the situation than I used to. 
The gradability, however, doesn't apply to the preposition by itself but to the larger expression
 * You 're ater home with trigonometry than I am.


* The predicand requirement for adjectives
Adjectives may relate to a predicand (predicative complements, predicative adjuncts). 
Prepositions can head adjuncts that are unassociated with any predicand. 


Anxious (AdjP adjunct)
[Anxious to make amends], the dean threw a party for the students.
*[Anxious to make amends], there was a party for the students.


After (PP adjunct)
[After the end of the semester], the dean threw a party for the students.
[After the end of the semester], there was a party for the students.




Adjuncts with the form of a PP >> there is no general constraint that they MUST be >> the preposition in can be the head of an adjunct that is not related to a predicand. 


* Complement of become


AdjPs >> predicative complement to be, appear, become, feel, seem. Prepositions can head PPs functioning as complement to be, but they occur less readily with the other verbs, normally do not occur with become. 


ADJP COMPLEMENTS
We are grateful to you.
We became grateful to you.


PP COMPLEMENTS
We are in your debt.
*We became in your debt.


The boss became angry.
*The boss became in a bad temper.


*They became in love, which is ungrammatical or
They became more and more in love.


CONCLUSION>> adjectives can normally head complements to become, whereas prepositions without modifiers normally cannot.


Prepositions vs verbs


We always follow the manual.
I advise you to follow the manual.
There are cases where historical change led to a word taking on the properties of a preposition in addition to its original verbal properties, so that it now belongs to both categories. 


PREPOSITION
Following the meeting, there will be a reception. [after]
Owing to the drought, many farms are going bankrupt. [because of]
Liz did remarkably well, given her inexperience. [taking X into account]


VERB
[Following the manual] Adj, we tried to figure out how to assemble the unit.
[Owing so much to the bank]Adj , farmers can't afford any luxuries.
Liz was given only three months to live.


Grammaticized uses of prepositions
The article was written by a first-year student.                         Passive
[The sudden death of the president] stunned the nation.        NP
I [transferred several hundred dollars to them].                        PP licensed by V
[Their request for assistance] was ignored.                        PP licensed by V
They all seem [quite keen on the idea].                                PP licensed by V


Those prepositions do not express spatial relations, but mark certain grammatical functions.


'Grammaticized' Preps are placed in sentences not because of what they mean but entirely on rules of the grammar. 


I sat by the door.
He went to Paris.


Only a few prepositions have grammaticised uses:
At        by        for        from        in        of        on        than        to        with.


Preposition
A relatively small category of words, with basic meanings predominantly having to do with relations in space and time, containing among its prototypical members grammaticised words that serve to mark various grammatical functions. 


Preposition stranding
Who did they vote for?                                                [interrogative]
I can 't find the book [which she was referring to].        [relative]


In some languages, e.g. Japanese, prepositions occur AFTER their NP complements. 


Prescriptive grammar note
Some of the more old-fashioned grammars state that ending a sentence with a preposition is incorrect or at least inelegant. The construction has been grammatical and commonplace in English for hundreds of years.


Alternative
For whom did they vote?
I can 't find the book [to which she was referring].


The fronted construction is more formal than the stranded one. 
Where did this come from?                 X                From where did this come ?
To what do you attribute this trend?   


*This is the safe [which the key to was stolen].
*I have a lecture ending at two [which I'll be free all day after].
* What way am I annoying you in ?


This is the safe [to which the key was stolen].
I have a lecture ending at two [after which I'll be free all day].
In what way am I annoying you ?


?That's the town [which I first met her in].


One thing that is never made clear in the books that recommend against stranding prepositions is that there are also syntactic circumstances that make the non-stranded version almost or completely impossible. 


That depends on [who I give it to]inte           *That depends on [to whom I give it]
What did you hit me for?         * For what did you hit me?      What for idiom
Which metals does it consist ofidiom?                ? Of which metals does it consist?


The structure of PPs
Can take various dependents, both complements and modifiers.


Complements
I was talking [to a friend].        I'm looking [for my glasses].        OBJECT NP
I regard her [as a friend].        I took him [for dead].                PREDICATIVE

I left [because I was tired].        We agreed [on how to proceed].        CLAUSE


(a) Object and predicative complements


OBJECT NP                        I was visiting a friend.
PREDICATIVE                I consider her [a friendJ.


AdjP         I regard her as very bright.
NP        They elected her as treasurer.


(b) PPs complements
PP complements to prepositions are of two kinds:
I stayed until after lunch with                 X        I stayed until the afternoon. 
from behind the curtain                 X        since before lunch.


to is selected by according, due, owing, prior, pursuant;
of is selected by ahead, because, instead, out, etc.; 
from is selected by away, apart, aside, etc.


(c) AdvPs
Some PreP + AdvP combinations could be seen as prepositions taking adverb phrases as complements:
before long, for later, until, recently, and a very few others.
Basically fixed phrases: we got before long                X         *after long


(d) Subordinate clauses
Including the prepositions that were traditionally classified as 'subordinating conjunctions'.


Prepositions with no complement
She went aboard.
The spare chairs are downstairs.


The exceptional preposition ago
It invariably FOLLOWS its complement. 


She arrived [two weeks ago].


The order here reflects the historical origin of ago: it derives from the form agone, past participle of go. Originally two weeks ago >> "two weeks gone" 


Dictionaries classify ago as an adverb, but: 


I spent two weeks in Paris.                *I spent two weeks ago in Paris.
*She arrived two weeks.                        She arrived two weeks ago.
I recall his behavior two weeks ago.        That was two weeks ago.


Modification


We had to leave [a few minutes before [the end]].  temporal/spatial extent
It landed [way behind us].     Extent expressed by adverbs (just, soon, way..)        
We went [straight home].     Extent expressed by adverbs (straight, soon, way..)


A number of PPs with metaphorical or idiomatic meanings are gradable:
completely out of his mind, 
quite in tune with my ideas, 
very much within the spirit of our policy.


PP complements in clause structure


Goal, source and location
Need to be licensed by the verb - normally, a verb of motion
We drove from Boston to New York.                                 [source + goal]
He jumped off the table into her arms.                        [goal]
She fell into the pool.                                                [goal and source]


Location complements 
The suitcase is underneath my bed.
She stayed in her bedroom all morning.


The complements of prepositional verbs
Grammaticised uses are those where a particular preposition is specified by the head of a VP. They are called prepositional verbs:
Intransitive
She abided by their decision. 
He asked for water. 
I'm counting on her help.
We came across some errors. 
The meal consists of fruit and vegetables.


Transitive - the PP complement follows an NP object.
He accused her of fraud. 
I won't hold it against you. 
He'll treat me to lunch.
She convinced us of her innocence. 
They supplied us with weapons.


Complement of the preposition is predicative (evident from the possibility of its having the form of an AdjP or bare role NP)
That counts as satisfactory. 
He had passed for dead. 
I served as secretary.
They rated it as a success. 
He took me for a fool.


The complement-licensing properties of the verbs specifically mention the particular preposition that heads the complement.


MORFO 1
Review
Modern and traditional descriptive approaches by Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum


1. Explain
   1. What implications does it have?
   2. Traditional grammars drew the wrong distinctions, adopted inappropriate criteria, and missed key generalizations, but outside of the linguistics profession they have gone unchallenged: the content of grammar books for school students or the general public has scarcely changed in two centuries. (page 1)
2. Explain
   1. And if some early grammarians seemed to think of English as a disreputable language needing to be cloaked in respectable Latin vestments, that view had largely faded by the mid-18th century.
3. Explain
   1. Some of the most obvious problems with traditional grammar stem from its tacit assumption that words can be assigned to their appropriate word classes (‘parts of speech’) by means of definitions based on vague, intuitive notions of meaning.
4. Explain
   1. of all phrase-structure syntax, is that expressions are made up of structurally distinct parts (constituents) which may themselves have subparts (subconstituents). Clauses are composed of phrases, phrases may contain other phrases, and the ultimate constituents are words. Traditional grammar does not really endorse this view, but rather seems to presuppose something more like dependency grammar, where expressions are sequences of words that bear dependency relations directly to each other.

Chapter 0 - Negation  


Negation is a linguistic, cognitive, and intellectual phenomenon.
Negative utterances characterize the human species since they are not part of any system of animal communication. 
Negation involves some comparison between a ‘real’ situation lacking some particular element and an unreal situation that does not lack it. 


How is negation marked?
* By individual words 
   * Not
   * No
   * Never
* By affixes
   *  ·n 't, un·, non· 
      * dislike, 
      * inattentive, 
      * non-negotiable, 
      * unwilling, 
      * homeless.


1. Ordinary versus Metalinguistic negation
He hasn't four kids; he has three.
He hasn't four kids; he has five.


2. Analytic versus Synthetic negation
        The negation morpheme is the separate word (not).
Not many people liked it. 
He did not have any money. 
This is not complete.
The negation morpheme is the suffix n't.
He didn't have any money.        
This isn't complete.


3. Verbal versus Non-verbal negation
The negation morpheme is the verbal suffix n't or not.
He doesn’t dine out.         
I couldn't ever lie to her.
She does not live here any more. 
She didn't tell me anything. 
The negation morpheme is on a non-verb
He never dines out.
I could never lie to her.
She told me nothing.
She no longer lives here.


Verbal negation 
Requires the insertion of dummy auxiliary; non-verbal negation never does. 
She is lenient with them.                 She isn't lenient with them.
She rejected his oﬀer.                 She didn't reject his oﬀer./*She not rejected his offer. 
         *She did reject his offer./She DID reject his offer.


She never/seldom/rarely rejected his offer.                                      


In imperative clauses
Be lenient with them.                Don't be lenient with them./*Not be lenient with them.
Reject his oﬀer.                        Don't reject his oﬀer./*Not reject his offer.         
Never reject his offer.                   
Never be lenient with them. 


It is vital that she not reject his offer. (subjunctive clause)
MARKING BY INFLECTION                        MARKING BY NOT
*It is vital [that we ben't disturbed].                It is vital [that we not be disturbed].
*It is vital [that he don't delay].                        It is vital [that he not delay].


Non-verbal clausal negation
Markers of non-verbal clause negation
not (modifying a constituent other than a verb)
nothing, never, few 
Not everybody agrees with you.                *Not somebody agrees with you.
Not all her friends supported her.                *Not each of her friends supported her.
Not even Tom liked it.                                *Not Tom liked it.


Chapter 1  - Adjectives & AdjP


How do we identify adjectives?
1. Meaning
   1. They express properties (people, concrete and abstract things)
2. Function - 
   1. Attributive 
      1. some hot soup        
      2. a jealous husband         
      3. an old car
   2. Predictive 
      1. The soup is hot.        
      2. He became jealous.
      3. They accompany verb to be - 
         1. Max was jealous. 
         2. The soup is hot. 
3. Gradability and inflection
   1. Degree - 
      1. fairy big, 
      2. surprisingly good, 
      3. very hot (How big..?, How jealous...?)
   2. Degree - 
      1. comparison (inflection, grade) - old, older, oldest
      d)  Modification
        They can be modified by adverbs.


How are adjectives different from nouns?

*Judgest        *sizest        *silkest                wisest        biggest        smoothest


Determiners

Wonderful silk                        wonderfully smooth
* Switching makes ungrammatical phrases


Function
The judge arrived.                *Wise arrived.


Overlap between categories
Many lexemes belong to both categories.
        The soup is cold.                I had a bad cold.


NOT NP
Fused modifier-head in a NP
        The first version wasn’t very good but [the second] was fine.
        I couldn’t afford even [the cheapest [of them].
        This tax cut will benefit only [the rich].

You enjoy it.                                        You seem appreciative.


Overlap between categories
Some belong to both categories.

        They are entertaining.
        The clock was broken.
* Add very and check if it is an Adjective.
* Add an object and then it is a Verb.


How are adjectives different from determinatives?
Not as sharply drawn as those between adjectives and nouns, or adjectives and verbs.
the/a differ a lot from prototypical adjectives in form and meaning.
        The dog barked.
        A dog barked.
        *dog barked
Articles are not gradable, cannot be used predicatively, mark NP (definite/indefinite)


                        Determinative                        Adjective
*She gave me the some apples.                She gave me the good apples.

I took some of the books.                        *I took good of the books.


Gradable/non-gradable adjectives
        Prototypical adjectives
* Comparative & superlative
* Take - very, too, pretty
        Non-gradable adjectives                        gradable use

Adjective Phrase
Structure


Almost always PP or subordinate clause
Afraid of the dark                        glad it was over
Kind to children                        busy making lunch
Remote from reality                        uncertain what to do
Good at chess                        thankful that no one had been hurt


What PoS may modify Adjectives?
Adverb phrase is the most common modifier
Determinatives, PP, NP
        Extremely hot                morally wrong                very useful
        This young                        that old                        much better
        Cautious to excess        dangerous in the extreme
        Five years old                two hours long                a bit overpowering


Predicative complements                     &                  Predicative adjuncts
The suggestion is ridiculous.           Unwilling to accept these terms, Max resigned.     
I consider the suggestion ridiculous.        
Max was unwilling to accept these terms.


Adjectives restricted to attributive/predicative function
A huge hole                        the hole was huge
Utter nonsense                *that nonsense is utter
*the asleep children        the children were asleep


Attributive only
Our future prospects
The only drawback
The main problem
The sole survivor
A mere child
The principal advantage


Never attributive
        The boy seemed afraid.
        The boy was alone.
        The baby looked content.
Restrictions often apply to certain senses of a lexeme.


attributive/non-attributive




Structural restrictions to attributive adjectives
        Cannot contain dependents that follow the head.
                She was devoted to her children.
                *a devoted to her children mother.
        A few post head dependents can occur with the attributive adjectives.
                The house was big enough.
                A big enough house.
                The result was better than we expected.
                A better than expected result


Other functions of Adjective Phrases
        Post positives
                Everything useful
                Everybody rich
                Children keen on sport
                The ones asleep
                The only modification possible


1. For each of the following adjectives, decide if it can be used in attributive function, predicative function, and postpositive function. Give evidence. Example: key
Answer:
	attributive
	the key factor
	 
	predicative
	This is key to the success of the project. (recent usage) 
	 
	postpositive
	*the factor key. 
?The factor key to the success of the project was our access to superior technology.


	Adjectives: beautiful, interesting, fun, delicious, big, distant


2. Classify the underlined words below as adjectives or nouns, justify your answer. 
She's a thorough professional.             There's an obvious flaw in the proposal.
Professional is clearly a noun. 
Obvious is an adjective. Used attributively/predicatively.
a highly obvious flaw
*a high obvious flaw
*He has an obvious 
He has a tendency to state the obvious (fused head)
the highly obvious
*the high obvious
*the obviouses
*He stated an obvious


3. Are the underlined words below adjectives, verbs, or are they ambiguous between the two categories? Give evidence for your answers.


The dog is barking again.                                     Their behaviour was disgusting.


Barking is a verb.                                        Disgusting is here an adjective. 
The dog barked again.                        Their behaviour was more disgusting than ever.
*Rex is more barking than Fido.                  Their behaviour was too disgusting for words.
*The dog is very barking.                                 Disgusting can also be a verb.
*The dog seems barking.                   They were clearly disgusting the audience yet again.


Attributive adjectives 
The distribution of adjectives in noun phrases closely resembles the distribution of adverbs in the VP. Cinque (1994) entertains two solutions to the question of where APs are generated; either they are adjoined to a maximal projection, or they are generated in distinct specifier positions of functional projections between D and NP. He concludes that the latter alternative is to be preferred on both conceptual and empirical reasons. 


Pre modifier order
Quirk et al. (1985) set out four positional classes of premodifiers: zone I (precentral); zone II (central); zone III (postcentral), and zone IV (prehead). 


Determinatives                         Premodifiers                                                 Head 
Precentral                 Central         Postcentral                 Prehead 
our                 Numerous                 splendid        African                 tourist                 attractions 
a                 Certain                                                         church       tower 
some                 intricate                 old                 interlocking                 Chinese    designs 
all the                 small                         carved         Chinese                 jade   idols 


Adjective ordering restrictions (AOR)
The premodifiers closest to the head are those most concerned with "properties which are (relatively) inherent in the head of the noun phrase, visually observable, and objectively recognisable or accessible"; and premodifiers furthest from the head are those most concerned with "what is relatively a matter of opinion, imposed on the head by the observer, not visually observed, and only subjectively accessible [sic]" (1985: 1341). 


The zones have further characteristics.


Zone I has words that function as intensifiers, such as certain, absolute, and feeble. 
Zone II has adjectives that can be intensified and compared; their function is to describe or characterize; examples include big, intelligent, slow, thick, interesting, angry. 
Zone III has -ed and -ing participles: e.g. “a retired colonel”,  “a working theory”, "interlocking designs". 
Zone IV has adjectives (such as American, Gothic, economic, medical, rural), and nouns (as in "Yorkshire women", "college students"). 


There are tendencies for the order of multiple modifiers within zones. For example, the order in zone II tends to be: nonderived modifiers + deverbal modifiers + denominal modifiers, and the order within the group of nonderived modifiers tends to be: size + length + height + others. A further tendency is for emotive, evaluative, or subjective adjectives to precede others (as in "beautiful warm weather"). 


To Huddleston and Pullum (2002), there are two types of premodifier order. There is a grammatically binding (“rigid”) order, by which “internal modifiers” precede “complements” (over-rewarded financial advisers) (2002: 452). Within “internal modifiers”, there is a “labile” order of seven content types (2002: 453.


Evaluative     General property      Age                  Colour    Proveenance     Manufacture Type     (Head)
attractive         tight-fitting             brand-new    pink        Italian                  lycra   women’s swimsuit 




Adjectives that denote quality have been argued to precede adjectives conveying size, which in turn precede adjectives conveying shape, and so on, in all languages. 


The current view in the literature is that modifying adjectives that are homophonous with reduced relatives, or exhibit a special intonation pattern (such as ‘comma’ or focus intonation) are allowed to escape ordering restrictions. All the other adjectives are subject to AOR. 1. 


Since the grammar contains no principle for ordering relative clauses with respect to each other their word order is predicted to be free.
Operator adjectives are freely ordered. The examples below show that sequences with multiple adjectives are not subject to ordering constraints if they contain one or more operator adjectives. In example (12) the operator adjective former is present and the word order is free. The same effect obtains in (13) where former is replaced with alleged. Substitute famous with any other non-operator adjective, and the results stay the same. 
(12) a. a famous former actor 
b. a former famous actor
(13) a. a famous alleged actor
 b. an alleged famous actor 


Example (14) shows that if two operator adjectives are present the ordering constraints are again lifted. No matter how we arrange the two adjectives with respect to each other the sequences that obtain are grammatical. 
         (14) a. an alleged former thief 
                 b. a former alleged thief 


Importantly, the different orderings also correspond to different things: (12a) does not allow the consistent continuation who is now forgotten, and it refers to someone famous who is no longer an actor. In contrast, (12b) can be consistently continued with who is now forgotten, and it refers to someone who is no longer famous or no longer an actor. Similarly, (14a) can be used to describe someone who is alleged to have formerly been a thief, while (14b) means something else: it characterizes a person who is no longer alleged to be a thief. 


Unlike non-definite superlative constructions, definite ones do not allow free word order: 
(32) a. The dean praised [the shortest Italian student]. 
b. # The dean praised [the Italian shortest student]. 


  



Absolute adjectives


Many prescriptive grammars and style guides include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be non-gradable (more perfect, most unique, most parallel, more unique).

Scope of a negation 
= the constituent that it has effect over. 


Negative marker (-n't)
Liz didn't delete the backup, because we found that on the other disk.
Liz didn't delete the backup because she wanted to be annoying; it was a genuine mistake.
Liz didn't delete the backup and the access log shows that.

1. Not many people believed him.   The negation has scope over many.
= The number of people who believed him was not large. There were not many people who believed him.

= The number of people who didn’t believe him was large. There were many people who didn’t believe him.
 
3. I didn’t omit my name deliberately.       The negation has scope over deliberately.
= Omitting my name was not something I did deliberately.  I omitted my name but it was not deliberate.


4. I deliberately didn’t omit my name.   Adverb deliberately has scope over the negation.
= Not omitting my name was something I did deliberately. I didn’t omit my name and it was deliberate. I deliberately chose not to omit my name.


5. You needn’t tell anyone about it.    The negation has scope over need.
= It isn’t necessary for you to tell anyone about it.
 
6. You mustn’t tell anyone about it.   Modal must has scope over the negation.
= It is necessary that you not tell anyone about it.

Ambiguity
John doesn’t beat his wife because he loves her. (McCawley p.573)
(a)    The PP [because] is outside of the scope of the negation.
= He loves her, so he doesn’t beat his wife.
(b)    The negation has scope over the PP [because]
= He beats her, but not because he loves her.


John found a job not far away, <and so did Mary/ *and neither did Mary>. 
= John found a job at a place that is not located far away. (There was an event of John finding a job, and the negation operates on an implicit location predicate). 


Mary is happy.                                         Mary is not happy.
Cannot be simultaneously true, but they can be simultaneously false.
un- prefixes to the gradable adjective happy, which is associated with a scale. 


                  unhappy           neither happy nor unhappy                  happy
                          ----------------------|----------------------|--------------------- 


Non-affirmative items
Polarity-sensitive items = occur in clauses of one polarity but not of the other
        some: positive orientation 
        any: negative orientation; non-affirmative item 


Declarative                        I don’t have any objections.
Interrogative
Positive                Do you have any objections?
Negative                Don’t you have any objections?


Clausal versus Sub-clausal negation
        The whole clause is negated.
                He didn't have any money.
                He wasn't kind.
        The negation only affects a phrase.
                He was unkind. 


How do we identify them?
        
Subclausal negation                                Clausal negation
*He was unkind, not even to me.                   He wasn't kind, not even to me.
He was unkind, and so was Sue.                   He wasn't kind, and neither was Sue.
He was unkind, wasn't he?                            He wasn't kind, was he?


Semantic diﬀerence                  
He was unkind. (if false >> He was not necessarily kind.)  
He wasn't kind. (if false>> He was kind.)


Nothing/no - generally mark clausal negation. 
Subclausal negation                        Clausal negation
She works for nothing.                                She's interested in nothing.
It was no mean achievement.                        It was no great deal.
This is a not uncommon mistake.                This is not an uncommon mistake.
Not surprisingly, he complained.                Surprisingly, he did not complain.


Clauses with approximate negators are negative clauses. (Tests for clausal negation)
Few of them realized that it was a hoax, did they?
A few of them realized that it was a hoax, didn’t they?


Yet, there are exceptional cases where NO marks sub clausal negation.
We were friends in no time. ... *not even when we were kids. (very quickly)
It was no mean achievement. (Great achievement)
Getting that degree was no mean achievement, wasn’t it?
        He is no ordinary genius. (exceptional genius)


Polarity
Polarity is the grammatical system that contrasts positive and negative clauses.
Positive  (unmarked)                It is raining.        
Negative (maked)                 It is not raining.
Positive and negative clauses cannot be both true, but they also cannot both be false.


How can we identify polarity?
(a) Addition of not even
* I have read your book, not even the introduction.
I haven't read your book, not even the introduction.


(b) Connective adjuncts so/neither/nor
Positive pairs - I have read your book, and so have my students.
Negative pairs - I haven't read your book, and neither have my students.
*I have read your book and neither have my students.
*I haven't read your book and so have my students.


(c) Confirmatory tags
Its polarity is the reverse of that of the clause to which it is attached:
They have read my book, haven 't they?
They haven 't read my book, have they?


Contrary vs. contradictory
Liz intentionally didn’t delete the backup. ⤇        They cannot be both T but can be both F.
Liz intentionally deleted the backup. 
Liz didn’t intentionally delete the backup. ⤇        They cannot be both T;F.




uncommon______________________________________not common_________________________________common


A fair number of words or larger expressions are polarity-sensitive in the sense that they occur readily in clauses of one polarity but not of the other. 


Non-affirmative items cannot occur in clauses that are both declarative and positive. 
*much 
I didn’t enjoy it much.                      *I enjoyed it much.                   I enjoyed it very/so much.
We don’t have much time.              *We have much time.                We have plenty of time.
Kim isn’t much of a dancer.            *Kim is much of a dancer.         Kim is quite a dancer.
 
The majority of polarity-sensitive items have negative orientation.
Have you any objections to make?    Who has any objections to make?
The restriction on non-affirmative items is that they cannot occur in clauses that are both declarative and positive.
Some items are non-affirmative only in certain senses or uses:
anyn, anybody, any longer/more, anyonen, anythingn, anywheren
at all, eithern, evern, longn, much, till/until, whatevern, yetn
daren, needn, bother ( + infinitival), budge, can bearn, can standn, have a cluen, lift a fingern, move a musclen, see a thingn
Polarity-sensitive and non-polarity-sensitive versions of anybody, either, long, and can stand:


NON-AFFIRMATIVE                        NOT POLARITY-SENSITIVE
Did you see anybody?                        Anybody can make promises.
I didn't see either of them.                        Either version would do.
I won't stay long.                                It has been a long day.
No one can stand the pressure.                Everyone can stand for a minute.
Dare/need are non-affirmative as modal auxiliaries but not as lexical verbs.


Other constructions that accept non-aﬀirmatives- Constructions with semantic affinities with negation accept non-affirmative items.


It is not only negatives and interrogatives that allow non-affirmative items...  
She was too taken aback to say anything.
She ran faster than she had ever run before.
We slipped away without anyone noticing.
All have semantic affinities with negation.


Some items (words or idioms) cannot be used (or cannot be used with the same sense) in positive declarative environments. 
In donkey's years ("since a very long time ago")
*I have seen my old school friend Pete in donkey's years.
I haven't seen my old school friend Pete in donkey's years.
I have not seen my old school friend Pete in donkey's years.
Not in donkey's years have I seen my old school friend Pete.
I have seen none of my old school friends in donkey's years.
Negative concord is not "double negation", it is multiple marking of a single negation at all relevant points in the negated clause:
I didn't never mean no harm to nobody or nothin'. = I didn't ever mean any harm to anybody or anything.
Don't give me no trouble. 


Negative polarity items (NPIs) can only occur in a limited set of environments, prototypically in the scope of negation. 
*The burglar left any traces. 
The burglar didn’t leave any traces. 
Nobody/ *everybody in my family has ever lived abroad. 
None / *all of the neighbours lifted a finger to help. 
John never/*always drinks a drop. 
a. Scope of semi-negative quantifiers and adverbs like few, at most, rarely, hardly: 
John hardly ever says anything. 


b. Complement clauses of “negative” predicates like doubt: 
I doubt that anyone saw anything. 


c. Clauses headed by without: 
Sue left without telling anyone. 


d. Clauses headed by before: 
Mary left before Bill could say anything. 


e. Relative clauses modifying a universal quantifier: 
Everyone who saw anything should report to the police. 


f. Antecedents of conditionals: 
If the burglar left any traces, we will find them. 


g. Comparison clauses: 
Fred is more intelligent than anyone I ever met. 


h. Questions: 
Did you see anything unusual last night? 


*I have seen Mary in weeks.                 I haven’t seen Mary in weeks. 
Nobody has seen Mary in weeks.                  *At most five people have seen Mary in weeks. 
*I will arrive until Wednesday.                  I won’t arrive until Wednesday. 
Nobody has arrived until Wednesday.          *At most five people have arrived until Wednesday. 
Nobody sings or dances.                      =         Nobody sings and nobody dances. 
At most five people sing or dance.               ≠         At most five people sing and at most five people dance. 


Prescriptive grammar note
Non-affirmative items in clauses with verbal negation:
I didn't see anybody.                        !I didn't see nobody.
He didn't say anything to anybody.                !He didn't say nothing to nobody.
This phenomenon is called negative concord. It isn't illogical. To think that the non-standard  dialects that use negative concord are illogical is to confuse logic and grammar. It is true that in logic two negatives cancel each other out and make a positive: It's not the case that he didn't speak to her is true if and only if he spoke to her. And in Standard English I didn't see nobody (with stress on nobody) implies that I did see somebody. But that isn't what it means in the non-standard dialects: as everyone knows, there it means that I didn't see anybody.  
Two grammatical negatives, but only one semantic negative. 
Also found in some standard languages: in Standard French, Italian, and Polish.
Standard English construction that marks negation twice: 
Pick up some cement? Not in my car you won't! 
means ... You won't pick up cement in my car, but it expresses the negation twice. 
Even formal Standard English has some constructions where negation is expressed more than once.  
I saw neither Kim nor Pat.                I didn't see either Kim or Pat.


Metalinguistic negation 
Rather than denying the truth of the positive counterpart, metalinguistic negation is used to object to its assertability. 
This is not a car. This is a Rolls-Royce. 
The king of France is not bald. There is no king of France. 
John didn’t eat SOME of the cake. He ate all of it. 
Neg-raising negation in matrix clause/interpreted in the embedded clause
John doesn’t think that it will rain today.         →         John thinks that it will not rain today. 
John doesn’t want Mary to leave.                 →         John wants Mary not to leave. 
It doesn’t seem that it will rain today.         →         It seems that it won’t rain today.
John doesn’t believe that Mary is sick.                 John believes that Mary isn’t sick. 
John doesn’t know that Mary is sick.                    John knows that Mary isn’t sick. 


Complexities
“Every boy didn’t run” is am­bigu­ous be­tween the read­ings
some boys didn’t run and some did and 
no boys ran; 
You may not go and that’s final!  ‘
deontic’ “not possible” 
This may not be the place
‘epistemic’  “possibly not”. 
English negative phenomena are by far the best-studied; examples include syntactic constructions 
This is it, isn’t it? 
variation (so didn’t I; ain’t got none), 
morphology (-n’t, -free, un-), (morpho)phonology (do/don’t),  
intonations (‘Riight’), 
lexemes sporting negation overt (never), incorporated (doubt, lack), calculated (few), entailed (prohibit), or presupposed (only).  


Negative Polarity Items 
(‘NPIs’ – like ever in He didn’t ever see  it) only in the scope of some negative element (*He ever saw it). 
Negative polarity is a variety of ‘negative concord’, but instead of negative elements, negative polarity uses non-negative elements, which can sometimes pick up ‘negativity by association’ and occur without overt negative (could care less < couldn’t care less). 
‘NPI’ is a term applied to lexical items, fixed phrases, or syntactic construction.
NPIs might be words that have an idiomatic sense in such contexts (not too bright, drink a drop); or a specific syntactic rule might be sensitive to negation, like Subject-Verb Inversion in Never/*Ever/*Frequently have I seen such a thing.  Or Have you ever been there?, (Tell me if he ever arrives, He’s better than we ever expected.  
English also has ‘Positive-Polarity items’ (would rather, sorta), which don’t occur in negative-polarity contexts.

CAPITULO 5  - Non-finite clauses and clauses without verbs


Four kinds of non-finite clause
GERUND-PARTICIPIAL                         Liz dreams of writing a novel.
PAST PARTICIPIAL                                 Liz has written a novel. 


Plain form:
BARE INFINITIVAL                                 Liz might write a novel.
TO-INFINITIVAL                                 Liz wants to write a novel.
REMEMBER: There is no form in the English verb paradigm called 'the infinitive'. 


The form of non-finite clauses
Contain a predicate that has the form of a VP headed by a secondary form of the verb. 
Can never contain a modal auxiliary (modals have only primary verb-forms).
Are normally embedded within a larger construction. 


A non-finite clause can't carry its own primary tense to convey the location in time of the action or situation it talks about:


I remembered to talk to my doctor.
I intended to talk to my doctor.


Intend vs. remember


I talked to my doctor. (self-sufficient)


Main clauses vs. non-finite clauses
a non-finite clause can have special subordinators (to/for);
a non-finite clause can lack overt subjects despite not being imperative;
when a non-finite clause has a personal pronoun as subject, that pronoun generally does not have the nominative case-form; 
under certain conditions a non-finite clause may have a non-subject NP left understood.


To and for
To - derives historically from the preposition to but long ago lost its prepositional properties. It is now unique: no other item has exactly the same grammatical properties. We take it to be a member of the subordinator category - a special marker for VPs of infinitival clauses.


[For John to lose his temper like that] is highly unusual.
We can't aﬀord [ for everyone to travel business class].


Again, the history goes back to the preposition for, but this for behaves as a clause subordinator. 


Interpreting subjectless clauses
Most non-finite clauses have no overt subject. But in a sense we understand them as having subjects. 
Liz wants (Liz) to write a novel. 
We therefore speak of it as the understood subject. There are actually two diﬀerent ways in which an understood subject is associated with a predicate: one way involves a grammatical linkage that we will refer to as syntactic determination and the other does not. 
a. Ed promised to resign from the board.
b. They called on Ed to resign from the board.


(a) Syntactic determination
We can immediately see what the understood subject must be, simply by looking at a linguistic antecedent that appears in some particular syntactic function in the matrix construction.
In [a], the matrix clause has the verb promise as its head verb, which means Ed did the promising, and this is enough to tell anyone the understood subject of resign.
In [b], Ed was the one they called on, so again we know that Ed is the one whose resignation is being discussed.
The retrieval of the missing subject is said to be syntactically determined: it is determined by a rule referring to the syntactic structure. 
[a] picks out a subject NP, while in [b] picks out an NP that is a complement in a PP. 


a. It is unwise to go swimming straight after a meal. 
b. It was unwise to invite Ed to the party.


(b) No syntactic determination
The meaning depends heavily on inference.
[a] applies quite generally: "It is unwise for anyone to go swimming straight after a meal."
[b] a particular event of inviting at some time in the past, and someone issued the invitation to Ed to the party.
Non-finite clauses functioning as adjunct
Having read the report, Mary was sure there had been a miscarriage of justice.
Having read the report  = adjunct
Missing subject of the non-finite retrievable by looking at the subject of the matrix clause (Mary).


When not so clear what the intended understood subject might be dangling modifiers/dangling participles. 


(a) Understood subject given by non-subject NP
% Born and bred in Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast was always my preferred destination to recharge and socialize from my teenage years.
% Jennifer Lopez stars as Marisa, a maid in a fancy New York City Hotel. While trying on a wealthy woman's dress, a handsome and rich politician mistakes her for a society woman.
(b) Understood subject not given by any NP
Sometimes no NP in the sentence gives us any clue about what we should take to be the understood subject. 
% Being desperately poor, paper was always scarce - as was ink. (a poet)
% Having failed once, is the fear of failure any less this time around?
Many speakers try to avoid those examples in careful writing (though it should be noted that the ones we have given appeared in carefully edited quality newspapers).  The following examples are very common:
In the long run, taking everything into account, which is the wisest choice?
Turing to last week, several numbers provided some reason for optimism.
Speaking of heroes, there's something kind of heroic about this show.


Shakespeare - Hamlet 
the ghost of Hamlet's father: 'Ts given out that, sleeping in mine orchard, a serpent stung me; 
sleep does not have the matrix subject - a serpent - as antecedent.


Naturally, a careful writer will examine drafts to remove ambiguities that would damage intelligibility; but the danger from adjunct non-finite clauses with missing subjects that are not syntactically determined is often exaggerated.


Non-finites with an overt subject
When a subject is overtly present in the non-finite clause its form may diﬀer from that of subjects in finite clauses.


a) Infinitival clauses
[For them to refuse you a visa] was quite outrageous.
All I want is [for us to be reunited].


b) Gerund-participials
Gerund-participial as complement (both genitive and non-genitive subjects)
In the following examples the clause is complement of the preposition on:
She insisted on [I/me being present throughout the interview].
She insisted on [her father's/her father being present throughout the interview].
She insisted on [there being a counsellor present throughout the interview].
If a personal pronoun subject is not in the genitive, then it takes accusative case. The genitive is characteristic of fairly formal style, and relatively infrequent. 


c) Gerund-participial as adjunct
The choice is between nominative and accusative:
She sought advice from Ed, [he being the most experienced of her colleagues].
She sought advice from Ed, [him being the most experienced of her colleagues].
accusative =  informal BUT construction is relatively formal, so the accusative tends to sound out of place here.
% They've arranged [for you and I to be picked up at six].
Hollow non-finite clauses


Non-subject element is missing yet recoverable from an antecedent expression:
embedded within a predicative complement- The house will be ready [for you to inspect _] in a few days.
complement  - The new car took me quite a long time [to get used to _].
indirect complement - The report was far too long [to read _ in one evening].
complement within an NP - The came up with a rather difficult argument [to refute _].
Complement - Her new book is definitely worth [looking at _] .


Their properties can be stated as follows:
Form: they are predominantly to-infinitival.
Function of missing element: this is normally direct object or object of a preposition.
Antecedent: the antecedent is normally an NP.
Function: a range of functions.


The functions of non-finite clauses
1. To-infinitivals - complement or modifier/adjunct 


SUBJECT - To turn back now would be a mistake.
EXTRAPOSED SUBJECT - It would be a mistake to turn back now.
EXTRAPOSED OBJECT - We considered it sensible to take legal advice.
INTERNAL COMP OF VERB - Her parents [intend [to buy her a car]].
COMP OF PREPOSITION - I go to the gym [in order to keep fit].
ADJUNCT IN CLAUSE - I go to the gym [to keep fit].
COMP OF NOUN - It provides [an opportunity [to broaden the mind]].
MODIFIER IN NP - We found a big box in which [to keep the CDs]. We found a big box to keep in the CDs.
COMP OF ADJECTIVE - He was anxious [to make a good impression].
INDIRECT COMP -  He's still too young [to be left alone].
Infinitivals don't generally function as complement to a preposition.
    
b) Interrogative infinitival - Infinitivals functioning as complement to verbs, prepositions, nouns and adjectives can be interrogative.


COMP OF VERB - I don't [know whether [to accept their offer].
COMP OF ADJECTIVE - I'm not [sure how [to proceed].
COMP OF PREPOSITION - They can't agree [on what [to do about it].
COMP OF NOUN - [A decision whether [to go ahead]] hasn 't been made.
Closed interrogatives are introduced by the subordinator whether and open ones by an interrogative phrase like who or which one or how. 


c) Bare infinitival - Occurs in only a very limited set of functions. 
They hardly occur except as internal complements of certain verbs, with no subject permitted:


You should take legal advice.                    [complement of modal auxiliary]
I want you to help clear up the garage.        [complement of help]
The devil made me do it.                        [complement of make, let, see, etc.]
All I did was ask a simple question.                 [complement of specifying be]


d) Gerund-participials
SUBJECT                                     Bringing your dad in on the deal was a great idea.
EXTRAPOSED SUBJECT                    It's been a pleasure talking to you both.
OBJECT                                I find talking to Max rather stressful.
EXTRAPOSED OBJECT                    He considers it a waste of time going to meetings.
INTERNAL COMP OF VERB              I remember telling you about her visit.
COMP OF PREPOSITION                He insists [on [checking everything himself]].
ADJUNCT IN CLAUSE                        Having read the paper, I can't see why you care.
MODIFIER IN NP                           Who was [the doctor performing the operation]?


e) Past-participials - They have a quite limited distribution.


INTERNAL COMP OF VERB may have a perfect or passive interpretation
She has written another novel.
I could have you dismissed on the spot.


MODIFIER IN NP interpreted as passive
[The guns stolen in the break-in] were recovered.


The catenative construction
Most cases where a non-finite clause is an internal complement of a verb illustrate the catenative construction.


NON-CATENATIVE INTERNAL COMPLEMENTS
Our goal is to eliminate all these errors in the next version.  X Our goal is an error-free version.
These rules are to protect the privacy of our clients.  X        These rules are for our clients' protection.
This made working with them [an unpleasant experience]obj
        This made the job [an unpleasant experience.]complement to job
I'd call [that]obj shirking your responsibilities.        X      I'd call that lazinesscomplement to that.
I felt anxious [watching you up there]adj..         


In the catenative construction, substitutions by other categories in similar ways are not possible. 


CATENATIVE COMP WITH seem                        Kim seemed to understand it.
CATENATIVE COMP WITH begin                         Kim began to understand it.
CATENATIVE COMP WITH hope                        Kim hoped to understand it.


They can take other categories of complement


NP (PREDICATIVE) WITH seem                Kim seemed [a keen student]Pred. compl. 
NP (OBJECT) WITH begin                        Kim began [the journey.]obj 
PP WITH hope                                 Kim hoped [for a successful outcome.]PP complement


'catenative' chains of verbs in which all except the last have a non-finite complement:


[She seems to want to stop trying to avoid meeting] him.


COMPLEMENT
to want to stop trying to avoid meeting him
to stop trying to avoid meeting him
trying to avoid meeting him
to avoid meeting him
meeting him


Simple and complex catenative constructions


SIMPLE CATENATIVE                        COMPLEX CATENATIVE
I promised to read the report.                We persuaded Sue to read the report.
We daren’t move the furniture.                We helped Sue move the furniture.
Max regrets locking the door.                I remember Sue locking the door.        .
Pat got nominated for treasurer.                He had Sue nominated for treasurer.
Ed seemed to me to cheer them up.        We rely on Sue to cheer them up.


Depending on the absence or presence between the matrix and dependent verbs of an intervening NP,  interpreted semantically as subject of the non-finite clause:
The simple catenative construction
No subject.
No intervening NP that is understood as the subject. 


Ordinary subjects vs raised subjects 


(a) To-infinitivals
ORDINARY SUBJECT                                         RAISED SUBJECT
Sara wanted to convince Ed.                         Sara seemed to convince Ed. 
semantically related to the  verb (or VP).                 doesn't have a  direct semantic relation  with the verb. 
Syntactically it is located in the matrix clause, but semantically it belongs solely in the embedded clause. 


Ways of testing for ordinary or raised subjects in catenative constructions 


1) Using passive infinitivals 
In a matrix clause with an ordinary subject, changing the subject changes the core meaning. Try making a transitive non-finite clause passive and switching the matrix clause subject with the infinitival clause object. 


If it has a raised subject the core meaning will remain the same. 


Active non-finite clause         Passive non-finite clause    Same meaning? 
ORDINARY SUBj Sara wanted to convince Ed. Ed wanted to be convinced by Sara. No RAISED SUBJ Sara seemed to convince Ed. Ed seemed to be convinced by Sara.              Yes 


Max began to sweep the floor.  .. more natural than   ?The floor began to be swept by Max. 


Max's jokes began to offend the audience.  The audience began to be offended by Max 's jokes. 
>> begin takes a  raised  subject: its  subject belongs semantically in the subordinate clause, and the meaning of begin applies to the sit­uation described in that clause.


2) Using dummy pronouns 
It and there are dummy elements inserted to satisfy the requirement that finite clauses (other than imperatives) must contain a subject. They cannot function as an ordinary subject to a catenative verb. An ordinary subject is semantically related to the catenative verb, and this is not possible with a meaningless dummy. But a dummy pronoun can occur as a raised subject provided the non-finite complement is of the appropriate kind.


(b) Gerund-participials 
ORDINARY SUBJECT                                 RAISED SUBJECT
Ed regrets interrupting me.                         Ed keeps interrupting me.
l regret being interrupted by Ed.                l keep being interrupted by Ed
*There regret being power black-outs.         There keep being power black-outs.


The situation of Ed interrupt­ing me occurred repeatedly: there is thus no direct semantic  relation between keep and its subject. Keep can take a dummy subject, but regret cannot. 


(c) Auxiliary verbs 
Catenative verbs, entering into the simple catenative construction. 
In general, they take raised subjects. Dare is exceptional. 
Kim daren 't beat Sue.                         Kim may beat Sue. 
Sue daren't be beaten by Kim.                 Sue may be beaten by Kim. 
* There daren 't be a reporter present.         There may be a reporter present.


The complex catenative construction
Contain an intervening NP, located between the two verbs and interpreted as  the  subject of the dependent clause. 


We  arranged [forsub  [them]Subj to meet the manager]. 
We  resented [[their]Subj] being given extra privileges]. 
We  counted [on [them ]compl. to support us]. 
We  believed [them]Ovbj. to be conspiring against us. 
  
They were believed to be conspiring against us. 
It was arranged for them to meet the manager. 


Insertion of adjuncts 
*We believed later them to be conspiring against us. 
We  arranged later for them to meet the manager. 
*We believed later their story. 


The 'pseudo-cleft' construction
*What we believed was them to be conspiring against us. 
What we arranged was for them to meet the manager. 


Ordinary  object vs  raised object 
An ordinary  object is semantically related to the matrix verb, while a  raised object is not: it is located syntactically in the matrix clause but belongs semantically in the catenative com­plement.


ORDINARY OBJECT                                         RAISED OBJECT 
Sarah wanted to convince Ed.                         Sarah seemed to convince Ed.
We  urged a specialist to examine Ed. ≠                We  wanted a specialist to examine Ed. =
                                                        no direct semantic relation between a specialist and want. What we wanted was not a specialist, but the examination of Ed by a specialist.


We  urged Ed to be examined by a specialist.    We wanted Ed to be examined by a specialist. 
*We urged there to be an adult present.                We  wanted there to be an adult present. 
*We urged it to be clear to Ed that he was on probation. We  wanted it to be clear to Ed that he was on probation. 




Verbless clauses 


The  predicator is  missing altogether. 
They have a much more restricted distribution than non-finites.
 
Verbless clauses as complement to a preposition 
There is no preposition that licenses ONLY a verbless clause as complement, but with and without accept non-finite and verbless clauses, and a few others, such as although, if, once, and while, accept three kinds of clauses - finite, non-finite, and verbless: 


He'd been on the beach [without anyone noticing him].         [non-finite]
He'd been on the beach [without [any sunscreen s] [on P].         [verbless] = There wasn't  any sunscreen on him
[While I was working in Boston] I lived with my aunt.         [finite] 
[While working in Boston] I lived with my aunt.                 [non-finite]
[While in Boston] I lived with my aunt.                         [verbless] 


Verbless clauses functioning directly as adjuncts 


Verbless clauses with a subject + predicate structure can function as adjuncts:
[The meeting finally over], they all adjourned to the local cafe. = when the meet­ing was finally over
The passengers, [many of them quite elderly], were forced to line up in the sun. = Many of  them were  quite elderly

With ordinary or raised subject or object? Are there any special syntactic or semantic restrictions on their catenative uses? 




CAPITULO 6  - Relativização


Nonrestrictive relatives are usually conceived of as a unitary type of relative clause (semantically and syntactically opposed to restrictive relatives). They may be of two types: clauses internal to the nominal projection that also contains the Head (integrated) or clauses generated independently of the sentence containing the Head (non-integrated, supplementary clauses).


(33) a. John, who/*that/*Ø got the offer, will probably refuse. 
   b. John, who/*that/*Ø we all know, would not have done that. 
 c. John, who/*that/*Ø we are all proud of, will soon be part of the President’s staff. 
(34) John, [PP to whom] we talked yesterday, said he strongly opposed the decision. 
(35) a. That woman, [IP compared to whom] Attila the Hun was an angel, is unfortunately my husband’s favorite aunt. 
b. ... delicious entertainments, [ CP to be admitted to one of which] was a privilege,...
c. ... certain steps against his treacherous brother, [ AdvP as to the precise nature of which] they could not be further enlightened. 


(44) a. Mark belongs to the Knights of Columbus, which organization has been condemned by the Jewish Defense League. 
(33) b. *Mark belongs to a club which organization has been condemned by the Jewish Defense League. (restrictive) 
(45) a. An accident on the road, in which accident several people were hurt.
    b. *The accident on the road in which accident several people were hurt...(restrictive) 
(46) a. This book, which masterpiece I have read twice.
     b. *The book which masterpiece I have read twice... (restrictive) 
(47) a. There were only thirteen senators present, which number was too few for a quorum. 
b. *These are the only thirteen senators present which number we had forgotten. (restrictive)


CAPITULO 7  - Verbos preposicionados e stranding




________________




Fossilisation
Some verb + preposition combinations are fossilized:
 I came across some letters written by my grandmother. 


Some verbs occur with more than one specified preposition, but they generally have very different meanings:
He was looking after me.                caring
He was looking for me.                        searching                
He was looking at me.                        watching


NON-FOSSILISED
I asked for some information.
the information [which I asked for]                relative clause, stranded
the information [for which I askedJ                relative clause


FOSSILISED
I came across some letters.
the letters [which I came across]                relative clause, stranded
*the letters [across which I came]                relative clause


The second type of relative clause construction separates the preposition from the verb which specifies it, whereas fossilization doesn't allow any departure from the fixed order of verb + preposition. 


The same kind of fossilization is found in transitive clauses. 


NON-FOSSILISED
He accused her of a crime.
the crime [which he accused her ofJ
the crime [f which he accused herJ


FOSSILISED
I Iet him off some work.
the work [which I let him gffJ
*the work [off which I let himJ


Let + off "allow not to do" is fossilized >>>  the preposition must follow the verb, with only the object intervening. 


Particles
Particles are the only complements which can freely come between the verb and its direct object. 


PARTICLE
She took the suitcase down.
She took down the suitcase.


NON-PARTICLE
She took the suitcase downstairs.
*She took downstairs the suitcase.
Particles are short words that with just one or two exceptions are all prepositions unaccompanied by any complement of their own:


along 
away
off 
On
back 
by 
down 
forward 
in
out 
over 
round 
under 
up


Particles can never precede an unstressed personal pronoun object:


One general constraint on the order 'particle + object' is that it is inadmissible She took it off.
* She took off it.


Verbal idioms


A verbal idiom is an idiom beginning with a verb:
Kick the bucket
Hold NP against NP 
come across NP
let NP off NP


V+P without a complement  - V is head P is complement 
Her father passed away. 
When will you grow up?
Kim and Pat have fallen out. 
Do you think the idea will catch on ?
Compare with         She came in.                 She went out.


V+P without complement + a P with NP complement -  lexical and syntactic units do not match




This ties in with your first point. 
I'm not going to put up with this any longer.
Liz just gets by on her pension. 
You should stand up to him.
Compare with         She came in with her uncle.


IMPORTANT
1. Idioms have special and unpredictable meanings. 
2. They do not also constitute special syntactic units with peculiar structure. 
3. In syntactic structure they are generally quite ordinary, and often identical to when the meaning is the literal and predictable one.
4. Idiom is a lexical concept. 
5. Idioms have to be listed and described in a dictionary of the language.


VP >>> ties + in + with your first point
a point which this ties in with 
a point with which this ties in. 
This ties in [well] with your first point. 
This ties in with your first point.   X  I won't hold it against you if you refuse.


Prepositional idioms and fossilization
Idioms beginning with a preposition. 
Preposition + noun + preposition - idiomatic in meaning and fossilized in syntax. 
by means of hard work
by virtue of her age
in photos of their parents


on behalfQ,f my son
in front q.f the car
to lJ.uestions of ethics


with effect from today
in league with the devil
with knowledge of his goals
Fossilisation means that the parts cannot be varied independently as freely as in


ordinary sequences. One reflection of this is that we cannot drop the first preposi-
tion in [i-ii], to yield NPs that can be used elsewhere, though we can do this in [iii] :


[4 1] i *Means of hard work enabled her to pass the exam.
ii *Virtue of her age led them to drop the charges.
iii Photos of their parents were lying on the table.
The expressions photos of their parents, questions of ethics and knowledge of his
goals are obviously NPs which in [40iii] happen to be functioning as complement
of a preposition but which can also appear in the normal range of NP functions, such
as subject in [4 1 iii].
The analysis of [40i-ii], however, is much less obvious. Many writers treat the


underlined sequences here as syntactic units, commonly called 'complex preposi-
tions'. The motivation for this lies in the meaning: in front of the car is semantically


comparable to behind the car, and this tempts grammarians to see in front of as an
element of the same kind as behind, only more complex in its internal structure. It
is a mistake, however. Semantic relations of this kind do not provide a reliable guide
to syntactic analysis.
For examples like those in [40i] there is compelling evidence that the structure is
the same as for [40iii], with the first preposition taking an NP as complement.
Notice that the noun can take pre-head dependents:
[42] by similar means on my son 's behalf with immediate effect
These show that the fossilization is only partial. The changes made here to the
sequence following the first preposition demonstrate clearly that it has the status of


3 Many grammars use the term 'phrasal verb' for some or all of the expressions we have been consid-
ering in §§7.3-4. We have not adopted this term. It is thoroughly misleading. It's not the whole


expressions fall out, tie in with, etc., that are verbs; it's just the lexemesfall, tie, etc.


Exercises 147
an NP. If by means of were really a single preposition, we wouldn't expect to be able
to insert similar after the first part of it and drop the last part to get by similar means.
Changes of this kind are not possible in [40ii], where the degree of fossilisation
is greater. A case can be made for treating the first two words as forming a unit that
takes the remainder as its complement. In front of the car, for example, will have a
unitary preposition in front as head, and of the car will be its complement.
That, however, is very different from taking in front of as a whole as a complex
preposition. The of in infront of the car actually belongs with the car, not with the


head in front. This is evident from the fact that if we omit the car when it is retriev-
able from the context, we must also drop the of Compare, for example:


[43] i a. She stood infront of the car.
ii a. She stood behind the car.


b. She stood in front.
b. She stood behind.


You can't say *She stood in front of From a syntactic point of view, therefore, it is
clearly not in front of that behaves like behind, but just in front; it differs from
behind in that it takes an optional complement with of, rather than an NP.
The same general point applies to the second preposition in the other sequences
in [40ii] .
Take in league with. We can have The two of them are in league with the devil or
just The two of them are in league (understood as "in league with each other").
This shows that from a syntactic point of view with belongs in the first instance
with the following NP, not with league.
In by virtue of her age we cannot omit of her age, but we can still show that of
forms a pp with her age. One piece of evidence is that the of can be repeated in


coordination, as in by virtue other age and other tamily commitments. The coor-
dinator and here is linking the two constituents that are underlined. They are PPs.


And that means by virtue of is not a preposition, not a syntactic unit of any sort.

MORFO 2
CAPÍTULO  0 Comparison (Superlative types)
1. Defining the construction
Comparison can be defined as a mental act by which two or more items are assigned a position on a predicative scale. If the positions on the scale are different, then we speak of the comparison of inequality, which finds its linguistic encoding in comparative constructions. Such a construction essentially involves: 
* a predicative scale;
* two NPs. 


1. Gandalf is taller than Aragon.


2. Types of comparative constructions


English has two grammatical constructions for expressing comparison: 
* a morphological one formed using the suffixes -er and -est and 
* a periphrastic one using "more", "most", "less" and "least".


As a general rule, words of one syllable require the suffix, while words of three or more syllables require "more" or "most". This leaves words of two syllables—these are idiomatic, some requiring the morphological construction, some requiring the syntactic and some able to use either (politer/more polite), with different frequencies according to context.


Morphological comparison (inflectional)


The suffixes -er and -est - of Germanic origin - are typically added to words that have fewer than three syllables.


Periphrastic comparison


In periphrastic constructions, the words "more"/"most" or "less"/"least" before an adjective or adverb express degree. The periphrastic construction is more with words of French or Latin derivation and with longer, technical, or infrequent words. 


Adjective        Comparative                Superlative
beautiful        more beautiful        most beautiful
big                bigger                        biggest
Curious        curiouser                curiousest
                More curious                most curious


Equality, Direction and Degree
Equality comparison
1. The car is as big as mine.


Relations in Equality Comparison
In constructions of the form as X as Y or the same X as Y, X and Y can be of a range of syntactic types.


2. Commitment is as important as a player’s talent.
3. Get the cash to him as soon as possible.


4. Commitment is important.
5. Get the cash to him soon.
Inequality non-scalar comparison 


6. The car’s size is different from mine.
Inequality Scalar Comparison
In English periphrastic comparatives, more and less are parallel to as in equality comparison, except that more can also directly modify a noun. 




Superlative 


7. This is the biggest car of all.


Term and Set comparison


Term (one to one)
        () Ed is [more tolerant than [he used to be]c]c.
        () [Kim´s version] is much superior [to Pat´s ___]. No immediate syntactic relation.
Set (one to group)
        () Ed made the most mistakes [of [them all]NP]PP
        () It sold for the highest price ever paid for a Van Gogh.
        () Ed made more mistakes than all the others.
        () It sold for a higher price than had ever been paid for a Van Gogh before.
Differences between term and set comparison
        () Peter is taller[ than [his twin brothers ____].
        () Peter is the tallest of the three.


Ellipsis in Comparative Constructions


Very commonly the complement clause in a comparative undergoes various amounts of partial reduction or ellipsis, sometimes to a quite extreme extent. 


(8) John owns [more horses than Bill owns] _______ .


The sequence ‘more horses than Bill owns’ is in an NP, and a constituent of the main clause, as can be seen from the fact that it can appear as a syntactic subject, and be conjoined with other simple NPs:


(9) [More horses than Bill owns] are sold every day
(10) John, Mary, and [more linguists than they could cope with] arrived at the party.


(11) John owns more horses than Bill/Bill does/does Bill/sheep.
(12) Name a linguist with more publications than Chomsky.
(13) He looks more intelligent with his glasses off than on.


Sentences like the last two demonstrate that the appropriate level at which ellipsis is recovered is not syntactic, but semantic: there is no syntactic constituent in the first portion of the sentence that could form an appropriate antecedent. 


They [rejected [the two [best] novels]]]
Kim [has [the [most valuable] collection [of [all]]]]
This [is[her [most perfectly] [[constructed] [novel]]]]
Pat  [made [the [most] [mistakes]]]. The cannot be replaced by her/this
He [offered me [the[least valuable] [of the paintings]]]
[The most [we can hope for]] is a 2% rise.
She’[s [the candidate [most likely] [to be elected]].

* primary forms show inﬂectional distinctions of tense (preterite vs present) and can occur as the sole verb in a canonical clause;

Heads, Complements and Adjuncts


The head determines its complements.
(1) a. Peter devoured the sandwich.
      b. *Peter devoured.
(2) a. James sent Peter an expensive present.
               b. *James sent Peter.


Phrases may also contain modifiers (or adjuncts).


(3) a. Jane [VP [VP offered advice to his students] in his office].
      b. Tom [VP [VP offered advice to his students] with love].


Head: A lexical or phrasal element that is essential in determining the category and internal structure of a larger phrase.
Complement: A phrasal element that a head must combine with – that is, one that is selected by the head. Complements include direct object, indirect object, predicative complement, and oblique complement.
Modifier: A phrasal element that is not selected by the head functions but which functions as a modifier of the head phrase, e.g., indicating the time, place, manner, or purpose of the
action expressed by a verb and its complements.


Obligatoriness: Complements are required phrases while modifiers are not.
(4) a. Eli placed the cushion behind him.
       b. Eli kept the cushion behind him.
       c. *Eli stayed the cushion behind him.
(5) a. *These ladies and gentlemen placed him busy.
      b. These ladies and gentlemen kept him busy.
      c. *These ladies and gentlemen stayed him busy.
(6) a. *He placed behind the bodyguard.
                  b. *He kept behind the bodyguard.
                  c. He stayed behind the bodyguard


Modifiers  
* serve to further refine the description of a situation; 
* are always optional and can iterate: 
a. We celebrated in the streets.
b. We celebrated in the streets/ in the rain/ on Tuesday/ in the morning.


Modifiers are optional. Their presence is not required by the grammar.
(7) a. John deposited some money in the bank.
       b. John deposited some money in the bank on Friday.
However, this ‘obligatoriness’ test is not always sufficient, for some verbs allow optional complements.
(8) a. He read (the book) for at least one hour every day.
                  b. It seems inappropriate (to me) to turn a simple wedding into a grand social occasion.


Iterability: In general two or more instances of the same modifier type can occur with the same head, but this is impossible for complements.
(9) a. *The UN blamed global warming [on humans] [on natural causes].
      b. The two had met [in Los Angeles] one night [at a bar] in June of that year.


Combinatory freedom: An adjunct can cooccur with a relatively broad range of heads whereas a complement is typically limited in its distribution.
(10) a. They sat/danced//walked/meditated on the hill.
         b. They walked on/over/under the hill.
(11) Bilbo  relies on/*at/*for Gandalf.


Structural Differences: In tree structures, complements combine with a lexical head (not a phrase) to form a minimal phrase whereas modifiers combine with a phrase to form a maximal phrase.


Ordering Differences: As a complement needs to combine with a lexical head first, complements typically precede modifiers.
(12) a. The hobbits met [Merry] [at Bucklebury Ferrys].
                    b. *The hobbit met [at Bucklebury Ferrys] [Merry].


Non-headed constructions
Supplementation and Modification are examples of non-headed constructions. That is, they are not tightly integrated into the syntactic structure, so they are not dependent on any head. 


Modifiers and supplements
        They were playing happily outside.
        I did it because they told me so.
        Happily, they were playing outside.
        I did it - because they told me so.


Supplements should be semantically compatible with their anchors. 


        (13) Bilbo leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to Frodo Baggins, his heir.


[his heir] is a nominal apposition. There is a relation set up between the anchor [Frodo Baggins], and the supplement, [his heir].


What is the difference between semantic compatibility and syntactic licensing?


(14) The Fellowship represents the Free Peoples of the West – Elves, Dwarves, Men, and Hobbits.
        
Given that these constructions basically function as appendages, you might say it's appropriate for the framework that describes them to be a theoretical appendage. Still, I was wondering whether there are other theoretical approaches out there that give more attention to this kind of construction, or integrate it better.
(15) a. They learn that Balin, who accompanied Bilbo, was killed by Orcs. 
        b. They learn that the dwarf who accompanied Bilbo was killed by Orcs.


Position
Appendages - attached loosely at the beginning or end of a clause.
() The hobbits live in the Shire - a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside.


Interpolation - located between the beginning and end of a main clause
        ()  Strider - that is Aragon  - guides the hobbits toward the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell.
() Gollum – who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring – guides the hobbits




Form of supplements
* Indicators - They clarify the semantic connection with the anchor (an explanation of the anchor, namely, that is, that is to say).
* Relative clauses - Huddleston and Pullum (2002, 2022) split relative constructions into integrated and supplemental variants, rather than into restrictive and non-restrictive. Supplementary relative clauses and other types of supplements (parenthetical sentential adverbs unfortunately, frankly), rather than modifying a head they attach to an anchor (the part of the clause which the supplement is semantically connected to). 
   * Trees in 1354
   * [Jill sold her shares in january]        
   * [The necklace] [which her mother gave her] [was in the safe]
* NPs - 
   * Adscriptive - gives a property. The supplements cannot not always be substituted by the original.
      *  Smaug, a powerful dragon, lives in the Lonely Mountain. 
   * Specifying - (known as apposition) provides an identity. The appositive NP may be substituted by the supplementation.
      * Benjamin Franklin was introduced to democratic ideals when he read [one of the most influential works of his time] - [John Locke's Two Treatises of Government].
      * They went to [Gandalf], [the only one who could help them].
* Content clauses - 


Non-finite clauses functioning as adjunct
One construction falls close to the boundary between the determined and non-determined constructions. 


Having read the report, Mary was sure there had been a miscarriage of justice.
Adjunct


The missing subject of the non-finite is retrievable by looking at the subject of the matrix clause. 


Dangling modifiers (or sometimes dangling participles)


(a) Understood subject given by non-subject NP


% Born and bred in Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast was always my preferred destination to recharge and socialize from my teenage years.
% Jennifer Lopez stars as Marisa, a maid in a fancy New York City Hotel. While trying on a wealthy woman 's dress, a handsome and rich politician mistakes her for a society woman.


(b) Understood subject not given by any NP


% Being desperately poor, paper was always scarce - as was ink.
% Having failed once, is the fear of failure any less this time around?


Turning to last week, several numbers provided some reason for optimism.
Speaking of heroes , there 's something kind of heroic about this show.


Prescriptive grammar note
Many of the more conservative usage manuals, and many editors and writing teachers, disapprove of ambiguity about the understood subject of a non-finite clause, and regard 'dangling modifiers' as errors. What they are claiming is (putting it in our terms) that the missing subject of a non-finite clause in adjunct function MUST be under obligatory syntactic determination by the subject of the matrix clause.Moreover, far from being uninterpretable, they are generally understood by everyone. 




CAPÌTULO 2 Raising versus control


Subject raising
* the subject moves out of its own clause into a higher one
* the clause out of which the subject moves is always nonfinite. 
The demonstration that English has subject raising relies on the existence of a special class of noun phrases. 
Control
* superficially similar phenomenon to raising.
Special subjects
English has three types of NPs whose distribution is restricted by comparison to ordinary NPs:
* expletive there,
* subjects of sentential idioms (known as subject idiom chunks), and
* weather it.
What makes these noun phrases special is that they must be licensed as subjects of an appropriate predicate (otherwise they are ungrammatical. Unless it is the subject of the appropriate predicate). That is, all three types of special subjects must be licensed in a local relation---specifically, as the subject of a particular type of predicate. 


Expletive there = subject of verbs of being in or coming into existence;
subject idiom chunks = subjects of sentential idioms;
weather it = mutual licensing relation with verbs of precipitation.
Expletive there
The first special subject is expletive there. Expletive there is only grammatical when the main verb of its clause belongs to a certain class of verbs---roughly speaking, verbs of being in existence or coming into existence (in green).
()
	a.
	

	After their military defeat, there arose among the Plains tribes a powerful spiritual movement.
	

	b.
	

	There is a problem.
	

	c.
	

	There began a reign of terror.
	

	d.
	

	In the end, there emerged a new caudillo.
	

	e.
	

	There ensued a period of unrest and lawlessness.
	

	f.
	

	There exists an antidote.
	

	g.
	

	There follows a section on the care of gerbils.
	

	h.
	

	There has occurred an unfortunate incident.
	

	i.
	

	There remains a single course of action.


Predicates that aren't verbs of (coming into) existence don't license expletive there (in red).
	()

	There rang the mail carrier.
	

	e.
	*
	There seems no solution.
	

	f.

	b.
	 
	There remain several vexing questions.
	Expletive it = a clausal subject;
Expletive there = NP (subject). 
Omitting expletive it and expletive there results in ungrammaticality.
()
	 
	*
	Remain several vexing questions.
	Expletive there differs from ordinary there in much the same way as expletive it differs from referential it. 
Expletive there is incompatible with stress
Ordinary there = phrases with a locative or directional meaning.
Not every English sentence has an expletive there counterpart. Expletive there is subject to a licensing condition (a necessary condition for its occurrence). Expletive there must be the subject of a verb of existence or coming into existence.
Accordingly, with phrases like right here and over there ordinary there is contradictory and redundant.
()
	a.
	#
	There comes the train right here.
	

	b.
	

	There comes the train over there.
	With expletive  there, both sentences in () are completely acceptable and unexceptional.

	a.
	

	There is a clean shirt right here.

Subject idiom chunks
The second type of special subjects are the subjects of sentential idioms like those in ().

	c.

	d.
	

	The jig is up.
	

	e.
	

	The pot is calling the kettle black.
	Although the sentences in () are not ungrammatical, they have only literal interpretations.
()
	a.
	 
	The cat is safe with her.
(can't mean: 'The secret is safe with her.')
	Weather it
Weather it is in a mutual licensing relationship with the verbs of precipitation (one licenses the other). As a result, other semantically conceivable subjects are not possible, as the contrast between (5) and (6) shows. 
()
	It is { hailing, pouring, raining, sleeting, snowing. }
	() *
	The {air, atmosphere, environment, precipitation, sky, weather } is { hailing, pouring, raining, sleeting, snowing. }
	Subject raising
Data
Consider the contrast between () and (). Why is the second pair grammatical (unexpectedly)?

	()

	b.

	The last two sentences contain two verbs, and hence two clauses, rather than just one. Notice that neither of the complement verbs in (7) licenses there, whereas both of the complement verbs in (8) do.

	Analysis
When the matrix clause contains seem or a similar verb, it is possible for the subject of the matrix clause to be licensed by the (more distant) predicate of the complement clause, rather than by the (closer) matrix predicate. Verbs that act as catalysts in this regard are called raising verbs.
Raising verbs are semantically deficient in not imposing selectional restrictions on the eventual matrix subject. Verbs ordinarily select subjects with particular semantic properties.
()
	a.
	 
	The { cat, #rock } is breathing.
	

	b.
	 
	More than a { week, #desk } has elapsed.
	

	c.
	 
	The { boy, #cockatoo } wrote an essay.
	Raising verbs, on the other hand, impose no such selectional restrictions. In fact, there is no reason to think that they are associated with a subject of their own at all. 
We are now in a position to derive a sentence like (). The derivation of the complement clause is given in () below. Notice that, the eventual matrix subject, expletive there, is licensed by virtue of being the specifier of a VP headed by a licensing verb (in this case, be).
()
	a.
	 
	  

	   
	b.
	 
	  

	

	Local (spec-head) licensing of there
	

	Substitute () as complement of to
	The result is not a well-formed sentence, so the complement subject must move to the matrix subject position. This movement is motivated because the complement subject has a nominative case feature that cannot be checked in the lower clause. 
()
	a.
	 
	He seems [ to have a problem. ]
	

	b.
	*
	Him seems [ to have a problem. ]
	It is this movement of the subject from the complement clause to the matrix clause that is called (subject) raising. Notice further that the locality constraint on there (according to which it must occupy the specifier position of a licensing verb) is maintained.
Further evidence for subject raising
By definition, all raising verbs take non-finite complements. In addition, some (though not all) of these verbs are able to take finite complements headed by the complementizer that..
()
	a.
	 
	Itexpl { appears, seems } [ that there is a problem. ]
	

	b.
	 
	Itexpl { appears, seems } [ that itweather is raining. ]
	

	c.
	 
	Itexpl { appears, seems } [ that the cat is out of the bag. ]
	The sentences above have two properties that support the analysis of subject raising just presented. First, as we mentioned, raising verbs impose no selectional restrictions on a subject. This is consistent with the fact that the matrix subject in the sentences in (23) is expletive it. In contrast to ordinary subjects, expletive it is semantically empty; that is, it has no properties such as animacy, humanness, and so on. Rather, it satisfies two purely syntactic functions---namely, satisfying the requirement that all clauses have subjects and entering into a case-checking relationship with the matrix. In other words, it fulfills exactly the same syntactic functions as a subject that has undergone raising. Second, according to the analysis of subject raising just presented, the matrix subject originates in the complement clause and is forced to move because its nominative case feature cannot be checked there. As the sentences in (23) show, this is exactly what happens when the complement of the raising verb is a finite clause. The complement subject's case feature can now be checked within the complement clause, and so there is no need for the complement subject to raise out of its clause.
Control
Subject raising verbs are not the only class of English verbs that take non-finite complements. Control verbs resemble raising verbs because both types of verbs take non-finite complement clauses headed by to. However, the two verb classes differ in their syntactic behavior in two important respects. 
Differences between control verbs and raising verbs
First difference
Control verbs impose selectional restrictions on their subjects. For instance, hope selects a human subject, a requirement that is not met in (25).
()
	 
	#
	The chrysalis hoped [ to become a butterfly. ]
	The restrictions imposed by the control verb are distinct from those imposed by the verb in the lower clause. In (), the matrix subject satisfies the selectional restrictions of hope, but not those of elapse.
()
	 
	#
	Larry hoped [ to elapse. ]
	Further evidence for the semantic independence of the matrix and the complement subjects comes from the subset of control verbs that also allow finite complements. In such cases, the matrix and complement subjects need not refer to the same discourse entity.
()
	 
	 
	Larry { decided, expected, hoped } ...
	

	a.
	 
	... [ that he would travel to Bhutan. ]
	

	b.
	 
	... [ that { we, she } would travel to Bhutan. ]
	However, when the complement of a control verb is nonfinite, the interpretation of the complement subject is constrained in a way that it isn't when the complement is finite. 
Notice that the counterparts of () with raising verbs replacing the control verbs in the matrix clause are completely ungrammatical.
()
	a.
	*
	Larry { appears, seems } [ that he has traveled to Bhutan. ]
	

	b.
	*
	Larry { appears, seems } [ that { we, she } have traveled to Bhutan. ]
	The reason is that nonexpletive subjects like Larry need a semantic role like agent, patient, recipient, and so on. Since raising verbs have no specifier, and since the complement position in () is filled by the that clause, the matrix subjects in () end up without a semantic role.
Second difference
Since control verbs require their own subject, but do not license any of the special subjects discussed earlier, these special subjects should be ruled out as the subjects of control verbs. 
()
	a.
	*
	There { attempted, decided, expected, hoped, tried } [ to be a problem. ]
	

	b.
	*
	Itweather { attempted, decided, expected, hoped, tried } [ to rain. ]
	

	c.

Raising X Control


Peter promised to visit Italy
Peter seems to have visited Italy.


Promise selects a subject Peter = control verb
Seem does not select for a subject = raising verb


Instead, Peter is selected by the infinitive and “raises” into the main clause from the lower clause. The important thing to keep in mind is that for verbs like seem, the subject starts inside of the lower clause. For verbs like promise, the subject starts outside of the lower clause.


a. Control verbs and adjectives: try, hope, eager, persuade, promise, consider, etc.
b. Raising verbs and adjectives: seem, appear, happen, likely, certain, believe, expect, etc.


Verbs like try are called ‘control’ or ‘equi’ verbs, where subject is understood to be ‘equivalent’ to the unexpressed subject of the infinitival VP. In lingustic terminology, the subject of the verb is said to ‘control’ the subject of the infinitival complement. Let us consider (1a)


(4) John tries [(for) John to fix the computer].


In this sentence it is John who does the action of fixing the computer. 


Meanwhile, verbs like seem are called ‘raising’ verbs. Consider the deep structure of (1b):


(5)  ⃤  seems [John to fix the computer].




All of the following diagnostic tests  may be used to determine if something is a raising or a control verb. 


Expletive subjects
Raising verbs often permit an alternation between a referential subject and an expletive subject. Control verbs don’t.


TEST Expletive IT
a. It seems that Peter has visited Italy
b. *It promised that Peter would visit Italy.


It does not have semantic content. 
It doesn’t refer to anything. 


How to apply the expletive subject test


1. Start with you original sentence → Peter promised to visit Italy
Peter seems to have visited Italy.
2. Replace the subject with an expletive, and make the lower clause finite → 
It promised that Peter had visited Italy.
It seems that Peter has visited Italy.


3. Check the grammaticality. If it’s grammatical, the verb is a raising verb.
                                * It promised that Peter had visited Italy.
It seems that Peter has visited Italy.


Expletive subjects do not serve a semantic function, but they do serve a syntactic function, namely, the Subject Condition. If there is nothing else in that place, then an expletive subject is inserted. 


Other types of expletive subjects in English.


a. It's raining.
b. It's hot outside. 
c. It was a dark and stormy night.


TEST Expletive THERE
It’s only possible to use expletive there with a particular class of verbs, namely, verbs which assert existence.


a. There is a book on the table. 
b. There are three women in the room.
There is a difference between raising and control verbs with respect to expletive there.


a. There seems to be a book on the table. 
b. *There wants to be a book on the table.
Expletive must be selected for by a particular predicate. Its appearance in () is because it has been selected for by the infinitive be in the lower clause. The reason it cannot appear in () is that want cannot select for there.
Applying the expletive subject THERE test
1. Take an existential sentence → There is a black cat in the room.
2. Put the predicate you’re testing (seem) into the sentence → There seems to be a black cat in the room.
3. Check the grammaticality. If it’s grammatical, then it’s a raising verb.
TEST Idiom chunks


a. The cat is out of the bag. 
b. The shit hit the fan. 


The cat seems to be out of the bag.                X                  ?The cat wants to be out of the bag.
The shit seems to have hit the fan.                X                ?The shit wants to have hit the fan.


With raising verbs, the idiom meaning is retained.  X        With control verbs it isn’t. 


The subject the cat in (?) can only be interpreted as an actual animal that wants to be out of a bag (literal reading) because it was never in the lower clause, and therefore cannot be interpreted with the idiomatic material.


Applying the idiom chunk test


1. Choose your favorite idiom → All hell broke loose.
2. Take the predicate you want to test (seem) and put it in the idiom → All hell seems to have broken loose.
3. Check whether the idiom meaning is retained. You’re not looking for (un)grammaticality, rather you’re looking for whether the idiom meaning survives. If the idiom meaning survives, then it’s a raising verb.  → All hell seems to have broken loose.
TEST Truth changing passive.
If you passivize the infinitive under a raising verb, it basically means the same as the active version. If you passivize the infinitive under a control structure, it means something very different.
a. The doctor seemed to examine Mary. ⩬ Mary seemed to be examined by the doctor. 
b. The doctor wanted to examine Mary.  ≠Mary wanted to be examined by the doctor


Applying the passivization test


1. Choose a sentence with a transitive verb → The kid mowed the grass.
Put the predicate you’re testing (seem) in the sentence → The kid seems to have mown the grass.
Passivize your original sentence → The grass was mown by the kid.
Put the predicate you’re testing (seem) in the sentence → The grass seems to have been mown by the kid.
Check whether the two sentences you’ve created mean the same thing 
→  The grass was mown by the kid = The grass seems to have been mown by the kid.  If the sentences are interchangeable, then it’s a raising verb.
Subj - For
Some control predicates allow both subject positions to be explicitly filled.  The subject of the infinitive appears after for.


a. *John seemed for Mary to read the book. 
b. John wished for Mary to leave.


Applying the Subj - For test


1. Make a sentence with the predicate you’re testing (wish) → Linda wishes to leave
2. Add a subject in the lower clause after for → Linda wishes for Peter to leave.
3. Check the grammaticality. If the sentence is grammatical, then it’s a control verb.
If the sentence is not grammatical, then you can conclude nothing. 


Be careful! The following three things are not the same. Do not confuse them.


Raising verb: A raising verb is a verb which raises a subject out of a lower clause. It involves phrasal movement. Examples of raising verbs in English are seem and appear.
Verb raising: Verb raising is when the head V raise. It is head-movement. In English, only the auxiliaries be and have undergo raising.
Raising to subject: Raising to subject describes when a phrase moves to the subject position. This can be clause-internal—movement from the verb phrase, or cross-clausal: movement across a raising verb.


PRO and pro
“big PRO” and “little pro”


pro = pronoun that appears in pro-drop languages (Swahili or Spanish). It’s just a regular pronoun, but it doesn’t have phonological content.
PRO = a special kind of pronoun that appears in one very particular position: spec of non-finite clauses. 
English doesn’t have pro, but it has PRO. 


The verb of the complement clause in a subject control sentence imposes selectional restrictions on its subject. Therefore, this verb needs a specifier position, which is occupied by a subject that is distinct from the matrix subject (though it will be coreferential with it). The way we represent this is by assuming that English has a silent pronoun, so-called PRO. It can be thought of as comparable to the 'you understood' of imperative sentences like ().


()        a.                 ___ be quiet!
b.                 You be quiet!


It is this silent pronoun that occupies Spec(VP) of the control verb's non finite complement, much as an overt pronoun occupies that position in a finite complement.

As the salesperson lays there on the ground, hurting all over from the wounds
he’s gotten after being thrown out, with great difficulty he asks the angry
person he’s tried to sell to: “Will you now buy my product?” The customer
is so surprised by the salesperson’s persistence that he exhausted and out of
pure compassion finally says, “Okay then! But only on the condition that [you
promise never to bother me again].”
[Some people still seem to have the same idea]. A tough job! If [you’ve ever
tried to persuade other people to buy your product or service], you also know
that this can be one of the most discouraging and difficult things to try to do
as a business owner. In fact, this way of trying to get business by trying to
persuade other people, is one of the factors that causes most business owners
to dislike, yes even hate, the process of marketing and selling. [It’s very tough
to try to convince other people to buy from you] - especially if it’s against their
will. After all, if [you try to persuade someone to buy from you], you try to
cause that person to do something. And usually there’s always some kind of
pressure involved in this process.




CAPÍTULO 3 Teoria de ligação


In which linguistic environments do English speakers normally use reflexive pronouns (i.e. forms like herself or ourselves), and where does it sound better to use a non reflexive pronoun (e.g. her, she, us, or we)?


Given the following sentences:


a.*We like us.
b.We like ourselves.
c.  She likes her. [where, she≠ her]
d. She likes herself.
e.  Nobody likes us.
F. *Leslie likes ourselves.
g.*Ourselves like us.
h.*Ourselves like ourselves.


We could hypothesize that
A reflexive pronoun can appear in a sentence only if that sentence also contains a preceding expression that has the same referent (i.e. a preceding coreferential expression); a non reflexive pronoun cannot appear in a sentence that contains such an expression.


The following examples are different from the previous ones in various ways, so they
provide a first test of our hypothesis:
(2) a. She voted for her. [she 6= her]
b. She voted for herself.
c. We voted for her.
d.*We voted for herself.
e.*We gave us presents.
f. We gave ourselves presents.
g.*We gave presents to us.
h. We gave presents to ourselves.
i.*We gave us to the cause.
j. We gave ourselves to the cause.
k.*Leslie told us about us.
l. Leslie told us about ourselves.
m.*Leslie told ourselves about us.
n.*Leslie told ourselves about ourselves.


These examples are all predicted by Hypothesis I, lending it some initial plausibility. But
here are some counterexamples:


(3) a. We think that Leslie likes us.
b.*We think that Leslie likes ourselves.


It isn’t actually the mere presence of the subordinate clauses in (3) that makes the
difference. To see why, consider the following, which contain subordinate clauses but are
covered by Hypothesis I.


(i) We think that she voted for her. [she 6= her]
(ii) We think that she voted for herself.
(iii)*We think that herself voted for her.
(iv)*We think that herself voted for herself.
A. Explain how Hypothesis I accounts for the data in (i)-(iv).


B. What is it about the subordinate clauses in (3) that makes them different from
those in (i)-(iv) with respect to Hypothesis I?


Given our investigation so far, then, we might revise Hypothesis I to the following:
Hypothesis II: A reflexive pronoun can appear in a clause only if that clause also
contains a preceding, coreferential expression; a nonreflexive pronoun cannot appear
in any clause that contains such an expression.


For sentences with only one clause (such as (1)-(2)), Hypothesis II makes the same
predictions as Hypothesis I. But it correctly permits (3a) because we and us are in
different clauses, and it rules out (3b) because we and ourselves are in different clauses.
However, Hypothesis II as stated won’t work either:


(4) a. Our friends like us.
b.*Our friends like ourselves.
c. Those pictures of us offended us.
d.*Those pictures of us offended ourselves.
e. We found your letter to us in the trash.
f.*We found your letter to ourselves in the trash.


What’s going on here? The acceptable examples of reflexive pronouns have been cases
(i) where the reflexive pronoun is functioning as an object of a verb (or the object of
a preposition that goes with the verb) and (ii) where the antecedent – that is, the
expression it is coreferential with – is the subject or a preceding object of the same verb.
If we think of a verb as denoting some sort of action or state, then the subject and objects
(or prepositional objects) normally refer to the participants in that action or state. These
are often called the arguments of the verb. In the examples in (4), unlike many of the
earlier examples, the reflexive pronouns and their antecedents are not arguments of the
same verb (or, in other words, they are not coarguments). For example in (4b), our
is just part of the subject of the verb like, and hence not itself an argument of the verb;
rather, it is our friends that denotes participants in the liking relation. Similarly, in (4e)
the arguments of found are we and your letter to us; us is only part of an argument of
found.


So to account for these differences, we can consider the following:
Hypothesis III: A reflexive pronoun must be an argument of a verb that has another
preceding argument with the same referent. A nonreflexive pronoun cannot appear
as an argument of a verb that has a preceding coreferential argument.


Each of the examples in (4) contains two coreferential expressions (we, us, our, or our-
selves), but none of them contains two coreferential expressions that are arguments ofthe same verb. Hypothesis III correctly rules out just those sentences in (4) in which the
second of the two coreferential expressions is the reflexive pronoun ourselves.


Now consider the following cases:
(5) a. Vote for us!
b.*Vote for ourselves!
c.*Vote for you!
d. Vote for yourself!


In (5d), for the first time, we find a well-formed reflexive with no antecedent. If we don’t
want to append an ad hoc codicil to Hypothesis III,5 we will need to posit a hidden
subject (namely, you) in imperative sentences.


Similar arguments can be made with respect to the following sentences.
(6) a. We appealed to them1 to vote for them2. [them1 6= them2]
b. We appealed to them to vote for themselves.
c. We appealed to them to vote for us.
(7) a. We appeared to them to vote for them.
b.*We appeared to them to vote for themselves.
c. We appeared to them to vote for ourselves.


In (6), the pronouns indicate that them is functioning as the subject of vote, but it
looks like it is the object of the preposition to, not an argument of vote. Likewise, in
(7), the pronouns suggest that we should be analyzed as an argument of vote, but its
position suggests that it is an argument of appeared. So, on the face of it, such examples
are problematical for Hypothesis III, unless we posit arguments that are not directly
observable. We will return to the analysis of such cases in later chapters.


For example, all the versions of the rules we have come up with so far predict that nonreflexive forms of a pronoun should appear only in positions where their reflexive counterparts are impossible. But this is not quite true, as the following examples
illustrate:
(8)
 a. We wrapped the blankets around us.
b. We wrapped the blankets around ourselves.
c. We admired the pictures of us in the album.
d. We admired the pictures of ourselves in the album.


It should be evident by now that formulating precise rules characterizing where English speakers use reflexive pronouns and where they use nonreflexive pronouns will be a difficult task. 


Exercices
Consider the following set of data, focusing on the usage of ‘self’ reflexive pronouns and personal pronouns:
(i)   
a.    He washed himself.
b.  *He washed herself.
c.  *He washed myself.
d.  *He washed ourselves.


(ii)   
a.  *He washed him. (‘he’ and ’him’ referring to the same person)
b.    He washed me.
c.    He washed her.
d.    He washed us.


Can you make a generalization about the usage of ‘self’ pronouns and personal pronouns like he here? 
Also consider the following imperatives:


(iii)   
a.    Wash yourself.
b.    Wash yourselves.
c.  *Wash myself.
d.  *Wash himself.
(iv)   
a.  *Wash you!
b.    Wash me!
c.    Wash him!
Can you explain why we can use yourself and yourselves but not you as the object of the imperatives here?




CAPÍTULO 4 Voz passiva
Passive clauses
* Passive clauses contrast with active clauses in a system called voice.
* Active is the default in the voice system.
* Enable us to LEAVE OUT something that would be obligatory in the active, namely a main clause subject.


The following two sentences are similar in their meanings:
a. One of Korea’s most famous poets wrote these lines.
b. These lines were written by one of Korea’s most famous poets.


But they are syntactically different.


Leaving out the obligatory SUBJECT.


*Built the house in 1960.                                The house was built in 1960.
*Damaged your car.                                        Your car was damaged.
* Know little about the cause of ALS.                        Little is known about the cause of ALS.
*Made mistakes.                                        Mistakes were made.


Restrictions to passivization


The town boasts a great beach.                         *A great beach is boasted by the town.
Max lacks tact.                                         *Tact is lacked by Max.
Jill has three wonderful kids.                                 * Three wonderful kids are had by Jilt.
The jug holds three liters.                                 *Three liters are held by the jug.
Duct tape held it in place.                                It was held in place by duct tape.


Compare the sentences:
a.*John has been [taken Bill to the library].
b.*John has been [chosen Bill for the position].
a. John has been [taken _____ to the library].
b. John has been [chosen _____ for the position].


The absence of the object in the passive is due to the fact that the object of the verb is promoted to the subject in the passive. The other subcategorization requirement stays unchanged, for example:    


a. Pat handed Chris a book.
b.*Pat handed Chris.
c.*Pat handed a book


a. Chris was handed a book (by Pat).
b.*Chris was handed (by Pat).


Morpho-syntactic changes
The passive adds the auxiliary verb be and changes the verb form of the active main verb into the passive.
 a.    John drovethe car.→The car was driven.
b.    John was driving the car.→The car was being driven.
c.    John will drive the car.→The car will be driven.
d.    John has driventhe car.→The car has been driven.
e.    John has been drivingthe car.→The car has been being driven.
f.    John will have been drivingthe car.→The car will have been being driven.


Raising Properties
The passive construction is similar to the raising construction. Whatever the active transitive verb requires, it must be the subject of a passive.   
a.    They believe it/*Stephen to be easy to annoy Ben.
b.    They believe there/Stephen to be a dragon in the wood.


a.    It/*Stephen is believed to be easy to annoy Fred
b.    There/Stephen is believed to be a dragon in the wood.


If the postverbal constituent must be a clause, so must be the subject of the passive verb:
a.    Everyone believes/*kicks that he is a fool.
b.    [That he is a fool] is believed/*kicked by everyone.


If the postverbal constituent can be understood as part of an idiom, so can be the subject:
a.    They believe the cat to be out of the bag.
b.    The cat is believed to be out of the bag.


Semantics
In terms of meaning, as noted before there is no change in the semantic role assigned  to  the  arguments.  The  difference  is  that  the  agent  denoted  by  the  active  subject  is expressed as an optional oblique argument of the PP headed by the preposition by in the passive:


a. Pat handed Chris a note
b. Chris was handed a note (by Pat)


a. TV puts ideas in children’s heads.
b. Ideas are put in children’s heads (by TV).


Constraints on the Affectedness
Earlier, we noted that verbs like resemble do not have passive forms even if there are transitive verbs. There seem to exist other verbs with no passive counterparts:


a.    They have a nice house.                *A nice house was had by them
b.    He lacks confidence.                *Confidence is lacked by him
c.    The coat does not fit you.        *You are not fit by the coat.


One can claim that these verbs lexically do not allow passive since they are inherently stative.


However, observe the following contrast:
a.  *Great wealth was possessed by the King.    The city was soon possessed by the enemy
b.  *Oil is held by the jar.                                The thief was held by the police.


.Why do have such a contrast? It appears that the semantic role assigned to the object seems to play a key role.


a.  *Jill was married by Jack.                                They were married by the priest
b.  *Four is equalled by two and two.                He is equalled in strength by no one.


Though married and equalled generally do not allow passive, they can be passivized when the passive subject is influenced or affected by the action denoted by the main verb. This affected condition can be further found in the following contrast: 


a.  *Six inches were grown by the boy.        The beans were grown by the gardener
b.  *A pound was weighed by the book.        The plums were weighed by the greengrocer.
c.  *A mile to work was run by him.                A mile was first run in four minutes by Bannister.


The main difference between possible and impossible examples here is that the passive subject is acted upon by an agent. That is, the passive subject is physically or psychologically affected by the action performed by the agent. The addition of this kind of ‘affectedness condition’ can account for the contrast in (56a) and (57b). Six inches cannot be affected by the action performed by the agent. But beans are under the direct influence from the action denoted by the gardener. The ‘affectedness condition’ can also predict the following contrast:


a.  *The bridge was walked under by several students.
b.    This bridge has been walked under by generations of lovers.


Even though the bridge will be not affected by some students who walked under the bridge by chance, it can have a new status when lovers choose the bridge as a regular dating course.


Other Types of Passive
Adjectival Passive


There are passive voice cases with adjectival properties.
a. Her actions embarrassed him.                He was embarrassed by her action.
b. His success intoxicated him.                He was intoxicated by his success.


These passives, though having corresponding actives, exhibit adjectival features as can be seen from the following contrast:


a.    His actions much/*very embarrassed her.
b.    His success much/*very elated him.
c.    Her failure much/*very concerned her. 


a. He was *much/very embarrassed by her actions.
b. He was *much/very elated by his success.
c. She was *much/very concerned by her failure.


Though the active verb (embarrass, elate, concern) can occur with the verb-modifying adverb much, the passive verb in (embarrass, elate, concern) cannot. It can occur only with the adjective-modifying adverb very. 


One additional constraint on these verbs is that many of these semi-passives have prepositions other than by: 


a.    They were all worried about the accident.
b.    I was surprised at her behavior.
c.    They are satisfied with his actions.
d.    John is interested in linguistics.


Get Passive


In certain environments, passives allow get instead of be:
a.    I got phoned by a woman friend
b.    Rosie got struck by lightning.
c.    He got hit in the face with the tip of a surfboard.
d.    Women get terribly worried about that.
.e.    When I start reading, I get motivated.
f.    John’s bike got fixed or got stolen.


Get passives usually convey the speaker’s personal involvement or reflect the speaker’s opinion as to whether the event described is perceived as having favorable or unfavorable consequences. This is why it is rather unacceptable to use the get passive when the subject-referent has no control over the process in question:


a.*The lesson got read by a choirboy.
b.*The letter got written by a poet.
c.*Tom got understood to have asked for a refund.
d.*Mary got heard to insult her parents.


This means that the verb get selected a VP[pass] with an additional semantic or pragmatic condition. 


Middle Voice
In addition to the active and passive voices, in English there exists another voice, often called ‘middle’. Consider the following:


a.    John opened the door.                                The door was opened by Joh
b.  John cooked the casserole in the oven.    The casserole was cooked in the oven by John. 


a.    The door opened.
b.    The casserole cooked in the oven.


The sentences in (71) are passive forms of those in (70). Then what about (72)? The subject here is identical with that of the passive, but the verb is not in the passive but in the active form. As such, an intransitive verb that appears to be active but expresses a passive action characterizes the English middle voice. That is, we can say that English middle voices are syntactically active but semantically passive:


a.    John rang the bell.→The bell rang.
b.    John broke the window.→The window broke.
c.    John smashed the vase.→The vase smashed.
d.    John melted the ice.→The ice melted.
e.    John sank the ship.→The ship sank.


However, not all transitive verbs have middle voices:
a.    John kicked the ball.→*The ball kicked.
b.    John hit the window.→*The window hit.
c.    John bought the vase.→*The vase bought.


Such middle voices in general describe permanent properties of the subject. This general semantic condition makes middle voice incompatible with duration adverbs:


a.    ??This car drove smoothly last night.
b.    ??This clothes washed well last night.


In addition, these middle verbs do not allow the by phrase:


a.  *The bell rang by John.
b.  *The window broke by the child.
c.  *The vase smashed by the baby.


Given these observations, we can introduce the following lexical rule for a limited set of transitive verbs in English:
* A verb selecting an agent and a theme argument can be turned into a verb selecting this theme as the subject. 


Exercises
1.    Consider the following examples and provide the active counterpart.


(i)
a.    That we should call the police was suggested by her son.
b.    Whether this is feasible hasn’t yet been determined.
c.    Paying taxes can’t be avoided.


Also see if there is any relationships between the above sentences with the following passives:


(ii) 
a.    It was suggested by her son that we should call the police.
b.    It hasn’t yet been determined whether this is feasible.
c.    It can’t be avoided paying taxes.


2.    The verbs like get and have can be used in so-called pseudo passives:


(i) 
a.    Frances has had the drapes cleaned.
b.    Shirley seems to have forgotten Fred promoted.


(ii) 
a.    Nina got Bills elected to the committee.
b.    We got our car radio stolen twice on holiday.


Check if we can replace the italicized verbs with different verb forms (e.g., base or infinitive) and then discuss if such a replacement test can tell us anything about the properties of such constructions.


3.    The  following  sentences  appear  to  have  similar  meanings.  Discuss  the  relationships among the following sentences if you can find any.


(i) 
a.    Joe rolled the barrel down the hill.
b.    Joe had the barrel rolled down the hill.
c.    The barrel was rolled down the hill.
d.    The barrel rolled down the hill.


4.    Consider the following passive examples.


(i) 
a.    We cannot put up with the noise anymore.
b.    He will keep up with their expectations.


(ii) 
a.    This noise cannot be put up with.
b.    Their expectations will be kept up with.


Do the Passive Lexical Rules proposed in this chapter explain such? 


Also observe the following examples which have two different kinds of passive:


(iii) 
a.    They paid a lot of attention to the matter.


(iv) 
a.    The matter was paid a lot of attention to.
b.    A lot of attention was paid to the matter.


Can you think of any way to account for such examples?


5.    Check if the following verbs are middle verbs or not. In doing so, try to construct relevant examples.


(i) fill, break, withdraw, move, march, jump, load


Also consider the following examples:


(ii) 
a.    These shirts wash *(well).
b.    The meat cuts *(easily).
c.    The books sell *(well).


In these examples, the presence of an adverb is obligatory. Are they any other verbs that behave like these? Also, provide a lexical rule that can capture such a middle formation operation.


6. Read the following passage and identify the errors in the verb’s verb form. In addition, provide the lexical information for the corrected form.


(i)    This survey aim at investigating the effectiveness of the appraisal system in our company. The survey conduct last month. The data collect by means of a questionnaire survey and three focus group interviews. In the questionnaire,respondents ask ten questions regarding the current appraisal system. It find that the respondents generally quite satisfy with the system, but about half of them state it should carry less frequently. In the focus group interviews, the respondents give the opportunity to discuss the system openly. Some respon-dents complain that the appraiser know too little about them to give detailed and objective comments. The findings indicate that the rationale for conduct-ing the appraisal exercise should explain more clearly to our staff


CHAPTER 5 Coordination and more


Coordination as a non-headed construction


[Jane is a good teacher] [and her students really like her].
They oﬀered us a choice of [red wine, white wine or beer].
Her assistant is [very young but a quick learner].


The coordinator is not one of the coordinates; it forms a constituent with the coordinate following it.


A: She's a good teacher        B : And her students really like her
bare coordinate                        expanded coordinate


Distinctive syntactic properties of coordination
* No limit on how many coordinates a coordination can have.
* Bare coordinates are required to be syntactically similar in certain ways.
* An expanded coordinate can never be preposed.


1. Nothing [noble, sublime, prefund, delicate, tasteful or even decent] ....
2. *We invited [the Smiths and because they can speak Italian].
3. *She argued [persuasively or that their offer should be rejected].


4. He won't reveal [the nature of the threat or where it came from].         [NP + clause]
5. I'll be back [next week or at the end of the month].                        [NP + PP]
6. He acted [selflessly and with no thought for the consequences].        [AdvP + PP]
7. They rejected the [United States and British] objections.                        [Nom + Adj]


They attended the dinner but they are not members.                           main clauses
The people [who attended the dinner but who are not members] owe $20. relative clauses
*The people [who attended the dinner but they are not members] owe $20. Only one relative clause.
*The people they are not members owe $20.


Head + dependent constructions:
They attended the dinner although they are not members.    Prep + content clause complement
* The people [who attended the dinner although who are not members] owe $20.
The people [who attended the dinner although they are not members] owe $20. Compl of Prep. is not a permitted function for relative clauses.


Kim and Pat like it. >> Kim likes it. Pat likes it.  *Kim like it. *Pat like it. 


It is completely inadmissible to prepose an expanded coordinate. 


1. *But they are not members, they attended the dinner.
2. Although they are not members, they attended the dinner.


The order of coordinates


Symmetric
We can have [beans or broccoli].
I was [sad and tired].
We can have [broccoli or beans].
I was [tired and sad].


Asymmetric
We were left [high and dry]. fossilised *We were left [dry and high].
I [got up and had breakfast]. I [had breakfast and got up]. 
Implication                 He [parked his car at a bus-stop and was fined].
[Pay within a week and you'll get a 10% discount].
[We need to pay the bill today or we won't get the discount].


The marking of coordination


Unmarked coordination
He felt [tired, depressed, listless].
Did they ever oﬀer you [red wine, white wine, beer]?


Repetition of coordinator
The coordinator can introduce all except the first of a series of coordinates. 
Expressions where one order is usual and familiar: knife and fork, hope and pray, men and women.
Fossilized expressions: hem and haw, for example, cannot be replaced by either of its coordinates.


Correlative coordination
The first coordinate can be marked by one of the determinatives both, either, and neither, paired respectively with the coordinators and, or, and nor (correlative coordination):
[Both the managing director and the company secretary] have been arrested.
It's one of those movies that you'll [either love or hate].
[Neither Sue nor her husband] supported the plan.


1. Evidence does not support that either and neither are restricted to two-coordinate constructions.
2. both to [the men and their employers] both is displaced [both the men and their employers]   
rapid changes [in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent] either is displaced  [rapid changes either [in the mixed liquor or in the effluent]. 


Some prescriptive grammarians insist that all displacements are errors.


Layered coordination
A coordinate can itself be a coordination:
[[Kim works in a bank and Pat is a teacher], but [Sam is still unemployed]].
You can have [[pancakes] or [egg and bacon]].
 [[Laurel and Hardy] and [Fred and Ginger]] are my favorite movie duos.


Main-clause and lower-level coordination


MAIN-CLAUSE COORDINATION    [It was a perfect day and everyone was in good spirits.]
LOWER-LEVEL COORDINATION
a. He [made a mistake or changed his mind].
b. We met [my bank manager and her husband] at the airport.
c. She introduced me to her [mother and father].


In many cases a lower-level coordination can be expanded into a logically equivalent main-clause one. 


i He made a mistake or he changed his mind.
ii We met my bank manager at the airport and we met her husband at the airport.
iii She introduced me to her mother and she introduced me to her father.


These are logically equivalent to [a, b, c], but there are subtle diﬀerences.


Non-equivalent main-clause and lower-level coordinations
a. One teacher was [popular and patient].
b. One teacher was popular and one teacher was patient.


a. No one [stood up and complained].
b. No one stood up and no one complained.


a. She didn’t have any [tea or coffee].
b. She didn't have any tea or she didn't have any coﬀee. Suppose she had tea but not coﬀee. 


DISTRIBUTIVE COORDINATION
a. [Kim and Pat] are fine players.
a. [Lee, Robin and Sam] like you.


JOINT COORDINATION
b. [Kim and Pat] are a good pair.
b. [Lee, Robin and Sam] like each other.
Joint coordination is almost always marked by the coordinator and. The central cases are NP coordinations. 


* It requires that each coordinate denote a member of a set.
* It requires that the coordinates belong to the same syntactic category.
* It disallows correlative coordination (*Both Kim and Pat are a good pair).


Non-basic coordination
The coordinates are either bare or expanded (by a coordinator or determinative). The coordinates can occur as constituents in non-coordination constructions.


Expansion of coordinates by modifiers
i She comes home [every Christmas and sometimes at Easter as well].
ii We could meet [on Friday or alternatively at the weekend if you prefer].
iii She can speak [French but not German].
iv He felt [not angry but rather deeply disappointed].
They are modifiers of the coordinate in which they are located. 


Gapped coordination
i Her son lives in Boston and her daughter _ in Chicago.
ii Kim joined the company in 1988, and Pat _ the following year
iii Sue wants to be a doctor not  _ a dentist.
The gap normally includes the verb, but can include other material too 


Right non-constituent coordination
We gave [Kim a book and Pat a CD].
They stay [in Boston during the week and with their parents at week-ends].
I could lend you [$30 now or $0 at the end of the week].


There are two distinctive properties here:
* the coordinates do not form constituents in corresponding non-coordination constructions.
* the coordinates are required to be syntactically parallel: the separate elements of each coordinate must have the same functions in corresponding non coordination constructions. * We gave [Kim $1,000 and generously to charity].


Delayed right constituent coordination
a. She [noticed but didn't comment on] his inconsistencies.
b. She [noticed his inconsistencies but didn't comment on them].


a. [Two perfect and four slightly damaged] copies were found.
b. [Two perfect copies and four slightly damaged ones] were found.


The delayed right constituent coordination construction has the following distinctive properties:
* At least one of the coordinates does not form a constituent in a corresponding non-coordination construction. In ‘She didn't comment on his inconsistencies’, for example, the underlined sequence is not a constituent, since ‘on’ is head of the pp ‘on his inconsistencies’. 
* Similarly ‘two perfect’ does not form a constituent ‘two perfect copies’, which consists of the determiner ‘two’ plus the head nominal ‘perfect copies’.
* The element on the right of the coordination (doubly underlined) is understood as related to each coordinate. In [i], for example, his inconsistencies is understood both as object of the verb noticed and as object of the preposition on.
* The term delayed right constituent coordination reﬂects the salient diﬀerence between this construction and basic coordination. In the latter the doubly underlined expression occurs earlier, as the rightmost constituent of the first coordinate (and then is repeated, normally in reduced form, at the end of the second): She noticed his inconsistencies but didn't comment on them. In the non-basic version, therefore, this element appears to be held back, delayed.


End-attachment coordination
One more non-basic coordination construction we should mention is seen in the [a] members of the following pairs:


Nonce constituents have constituent status only for one special occasion, by courtesy of the coordination relation. We call this construction right nonce-constituent coordination because the coordinations occur to the right of the head (predicator) of the clause - gave, stay and lend in our examples.
a. Kim was included on the shortlist, but not Pat.
b. [Kim but not Pat] was included on the shortlist.
a. They've charged the boss with perjury - and her secretary.
b. They've charged [the boss and her secretary with perjury.


They diﬀer from the more elementary [b] versions in that the second coordinate (including the coordinator) is not adjacent to the first but is attached at the end of the clause. The relation marked by the coordinators but and and is still expressed, but in the [a] examples the constituents related by the coordinators don't make up a constituent.


Exercises
1. Consider the determinatives both, either, and neither that occur in correlative coordinations. Which, if any, can occur introducing main clause coordinations? Give grammatical and ungrammatical examples to support your answer.


2. Cases like ‘What are you looking at?’ were considered as illustrating preposition stranding. Consider the question of whether coordinators can be stranded, illustrating your discussion with grammatical and ungrammatical sequences of words as appropriate.


3. Some prescriptive manuals and English teachers advise against beginning a sentence with a coordinator. Choose a published work that you think is a good example of written Standard English, preferably one that you enjoy and admire, and read from the beginning looking for a sentence that begins with a coordinator (And, Or, But). How many sentences did you have to read before you found one?


4. Choose a published work that you think is a good example of written Standard English, preferably one that you enjoy and admire, and read it from the beginning, keeping count of each coordinate structure you encounter. At what point do you find the first one that has coordinates of diﬀerent categories? How many sentences did you have to read before you found one?


5. Explain why the following coordinations are asymmetric.
i He lost control of the car and crashed into a tree.
ii Talk to me like that again and you'll be fired.
iii Don 't tell anyone or we 'll be in heaps of trouble.
iv You can 't work 18 hours a day and not endanger your health.
v You can eat as much of this as you like and not put on any weight.


6. Explain why the following lower-level coordinations are not equivalent to main clause coordination.
i Who went to the movies and left the house unlocked?
ii Did she take the car and go to the beach?
iii The last and most telling objection concerned the cost.
iv They could find nothing wrong with the batter or with the thermostat.
v One guy was drunk and abusive.


7. For each of the following examples, say which kind of non-basic coordination construction it exemplifies.
i I'd expected Jill to back us, but not her father.
ii It was criticized by some for being too long and by others for being too short.
iii Both the British and the French delegates supported the proposal.
iv You can have a banana or else an apple instead.
v Mary left the country in May and the rest of the family in June.


CHAPTER 6 Topic and focus


Topic-comment 
Topic, or theme, of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the comment is what is being said about the topic. The topic of a sentence is distinct from the subject. The topic is defined by pragmatic considerations (it is the context that provides meaning). The subject is defined by syntax. In any given sentence the topic and subject may be the same, but they need not be. 


(1)
As for [the little girl]topic, [the dog]subject bit her.


In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition by.


(2)
[The little girl]subject & topic was bitten by [the dog]complement of Prep & agent


The topic of a sentence denotes an entity which is presented as already existing in the discourse and belongs to the common ground shared by communicative agents. The comment denotes the proposition that “is about” the topic. Topichood can thus be conceived as an “aboutness” relationship holding between an argument (the sentence-topic) and a  proposition  (the  comment)  relative  to  a communicative context.


It  is  often claimed that in English the topic is usually realized as the grammatical subject; accordingly, the unmarked realization of topics  in  English  would  be  by means of the  grammatical  subject.  For example, once question (1a) has been uttered, the denotation of the subject Peter belongs to the discourse.


(1)   
a. Where is Peter? 
b. Petertopic is in Londoncomment  


Topic and subject


(2) Paris is lovely in the spring.
subject =  topic


(3) 
i [Something]subject is wrong with this disk drive. 
ii In space, [nobody]subject can hear you scream.  
iii [It]subject is time these kids were in bed. 


When a topic does not correspond to the grammatical subject, then the basic SVO order may be modified by  means  of a  syntactic  operation  called  topicalization.  


Topicalization  is  a  movement operation that targets a syntactic constituent and displaces it to the front of the clause. Examples (4a) and (4b) illustrate, respectively, an object topicalization and a PP topicalization.  


(4)   
a. [This man]i topic Isubject have never seen comment  ti
b. [With Peter]i Mary went to school ti  


It is thus obvious that  the  topic-comment articulation is not equivalent  to  the  subject-predicate articulation. Indeed, the constituent with which the verb agrees may be different from the topic, as illustrated, and  it  is  also possible that the comment includes  the subject.
‘Sentence topic’ vs ‘discourse topic.’
A sentence topic is a syntactic category that newly introduces a referent as what the rest of the sentence is about, while a discourse topic is what the whole discourse is about and therefore can be more abstract. A sentence topic can be identified as the item X in the answer to the request tell me about X. Thus, John in Speaker B’s utterance below is a sentence topic. 


(5) 
A: Tell me about John.
B: Well, Johnsentence topic is a student from Canada.
Sentence topics must also be distinguished from items that simply refer back to them. The pronoun he in the reply by B is not a sentence topic. It does not newly introduce the referent as what the sentence is about. It is merely a discourse anaphoric item whose antecedent happens to be a sentence  topic. 


(6) 
A: Who did Maxtopic see yesterday?
B: Heanaphora saw ROSA yesterday.


Not all clauses have topic phrases. English does not indicate the topic of a clause by any grammatical marker, and it certainly does not always make topics subjects. There is very often no clear-cut single answer to the question of what the topic of a clause is. In English, then, there is nothing like a one-to-one relation either between subject and actor or between subject and topic. 
The focus-background articulation. 
The focus of a clause denotes an entity that is opposed to a set of alternatives. The background  conveys the information that is assumed by  the  speaker  to be shared by him  and  the  hearer(s) (small capitals indicate focus).


(7)  
a. I invitedbackground YOUR BROTHER  


(8) You invited Teresa.
Possible claims:
b. YOUR BROTHER I invited 
c. It is YOUR BROTHER that I invited.  


In English focus elements are marked by means of a nuclear pitch accent. It is also possible to displace the focus constituent to the front of the  clause, and  also  to  resort  to cleft  constructions..  In  all  cases, the focus element preserves focal stress.  


The  topic-comment  and  the  focus-background  articulations  are  relative  to  a  level  of interpretation  responsible  for  the  packaging  of  utterances  by  linking  their  information  to  the prior  communicative  context.  


Focus refers to the marking of constituents in an utterance that constitute news, or contribute to the speaker’s conversational goals. Focus provides a highlighted piece of information with respect to the rest of the sentence. As such, it can be identified as the item that answers the wh-part of a preceding question  Thus, Rosa in (3) is a focus, for instance.


(5)I made a lot of cookies. A couple of POUNDS I think I made for her.


Non-canonical order


1. Active: The cat swiped the dog on the nose.
2. Passive: The dog was swiped on the nose by the cat.
3. Heavy-NP-shifted: The cat swiped on the nose of the dog that had frightened it.
4. Topicalization: The DOG the cat swiped on the nose, while the ferret got away.
5. Clefting: It was the dog that the cat swiped on the nose.


CHAPTER 7 Information packaging in the clause


* They are non-canonical constructions; characteristically, they have a syntactically more elementary or basic counterpart.
* They generally have the same core meaning as their basic counterpart, but they present - or 'package' - the information differently.
Extraposition
Two extraposition constructions: subject extraposition and internal complement extraposition.
Extraposed Subject
Clause is outside the VP.
Usually admissible only with subordinate clauses.
[That he was acquitted] disturbs her.                        It disturbs her [that he was acquitted].
[How she escaped] remains a mystery.                It remains a mystery [how she escaped].
[To give up now] would be a mistake.                        It would be a mistake [to give up now].


Internal Complement Extraposition
*l find [that he gave up] disappointing.
I find it disappointing that he gave up.
* She considers [that I didn 't consult her] quite outrageous. 
She considers it quite outrageous that I didn't consult her.


Existential clauses
* Dummy ‘there’.
Some keys were near the safe.                There were some keys near the safe.
A nurse was present.                                There was a nurse present.


UNGRAMMATICAL BASIC VERSION (no internal Comp)
There is a god.                        *A god is.
There are many species of spiders.        *Many species of spiders are.
There has been no news of them.        *No news of them has been.
There was a serious accident.        *A serious accident was.
The it-cleft construction
[Sue] introduced [Jim] to [Pat]. 
Foregrounding                It was Jim who Sue introduced to Pat.
It was Pat who Sue introduced Jim to.
It was Sue who introduced Jim to Pat.
Ambiguous
It was the song that impressed them.
        It was the song that impressed them.         What impressed them?
        It was the song that impressed them.                Why that song?
Pseudo-clefts
                                        Backgrounded 
We need more time.                         What we need is more time.
He claims he was insulted.                 What he claims is that he was insulted.
I'll postpone the meeting.                 What I'll do is postpone the meeting.
Fused relative.. That which we need is more time.
Dislocation
Extraposition is not right dislocation. (dummy ‘it’)
Extra NP located to the left or right of the main part of the clause. (intonation)
[It] remains a mystery [how she escaped]. (How she escaped remains a mystery)
One of my cousins has triplets.                          [One of my cousins], [she] has triplets.
I think the man next door's car was stolen.      [The man next door], I think [his] car was stolen.
Her father can be very judgemental.                        [He] can be very judgemental, [her father].
Preposing and postposing
PREPOSING                        Some of them he hadn’t even read.
POSTPOSING                I understood eventually the reason for their antagonism.
INVERSION                        Never had l felt so alone. [subject-auxiliary inversion]
                                In the drawer was a gun. [subject-dependent inversion]
Preposing of adjuncts occurs relatively freely. 
Preposed complement serves as a link to preceding discourse. >> Costume jewellery, they made.


Presence of Aux required
The pain was so bad that I fainted.                        So bad was the pain that I fainted.
I realised my mistake only later.                        Only later did I realise my mistake.


SUBJECT-DEPENDENT INVERSION
A bowl of fruit was on her desk.                 On her desk was a bowl of fruit.
The view from the top is even better.         Even better is the view from the top.

1 Introduction
The bulk of this chapter is concered with a family of constructions
which we illustrate initially in the [a) members of the following pairs:
[ 1 ] a. Her son was arrested by the police.
ii a. It 's unusualfor her to be this late.
iii a. There were two doctors on the plane.
b. The police arrested her son.
b. For her to be this late is unusual.
b. Two doctors were on the plane.
Example [ia) belongs to the passive construction, [iia) to the extraposition
construction, and [iiia) to the existential construction. These constructions have the
following properties in common:
[2] They are non-canonical constrctions; characteristically, they have a
syntactically more elementary or basic counterpart, given here in the
[b] examples.
ii They generally have the same core meaning as their basic counterpart, but
they present - or 'package' - the information diﬀerently.
The basic counterpart
The [b) examples in [ 1 ) are all structurally simpler than those in [a], as is evident
from the fact that the latter contain extra words - the auxiliary be and the preposition by in [ia), the dummy pronouns it and there in [iia/iiia) . In the examples chosen,
the [b) versions are all canonical clauses, but there are similar pairs where both
members are non-canonical, as in the negatives Her son wasn 't arrested by the
police and The police didn 't arrest her son.
238
§ 1 Introduction 239
For the passive, there is an established name for the basic counterpart: [ l ib] is an
active clause. But there is no established name for [iib] : this is simply the nonextraposition counterpart of [iia]. Similarly, [iiib] is just the non-existential counterpart of [iiia] . And this will be the case with the other constructions we deal with
in this chapter: we have special names for the non-basic constructions, but not for
their basic counterparts.
Exceptional cases without a grammatically well-formed basic counterpart
We said that the non-canonical clauses CHARACTERISTICALLY have syntactically
more basic counterparts. There are exceptions. In some cases the basic counterpart is in fact ungrammatical. This can arise, for example, with the existential
construction:
[3] EXISTENTIAL
a. There was a bottle ofwine on the table.
ii a. There is plent oftime.
NON-EXISTENTIAL
b. A bottle ofwine was on the table.
b. *Plent oftime is.
Both versions are permitted in [3i] (or in our original pair [ 1 iii]), but only the existential version is grammatical in [3ii] . The verb be can't normally occur without an
interal complement, so [3iib] is ungrammatical. There are other cases of this sort,
as we'll see later.
Core meaning and information packaging
The pairs in [ 1 ] have the same core meaning in the sense explained in Ch. 1 3, §4.2:
since they are declarative clauses, having the same core meaning is a matter of
having the same truth conditions. With pair [i], for example, if it's true that her son
was arrested by the police it must be true that the police arrested her son, and vice
versa. And likewise if [ia] is false, [ib] must be false too. The diﬀerences have to do
not with the information presented but how it is organised and presented: the two
clauses in each pair PACKAGE THE INFORMATION DIFFERENTLY . We refer collectively
to the passive, extraposition and existential constructions - and others to be introduced below - as information-packaging constructions: they depart from the
most elementary syntactic structure in order to package the information in special
ways. Our major concer in this chapter will therefore be to describe the syntactic
diﬀerences between these constructions and their basic counterparts and to investigate the factors which favour or disfavour the use of one of these constructions
rather than the more basic counterpart.
Exceptional cases where the core meanings are diﬀerent
We have said that clauses belonging to one of the information-packaging constructions GENERALLY have the same core meaning as their basic counterpart: the qualifcation is needed because there are special factors that can cause a diﬀerence in the
core meanings. Consider the following existential/non-existential pair:
240 Chapter 1 5 Information packaging in the clause
[4] EXISTENTIAL NON-EXISTENTIAL
a. There weren 't many members present. b. Many members weren 't present.
Suppose we are talking about the annual general meeting of a large organisation. It's
perfectly possible for [b] to be true while [a] is false: thousands of members were
not present, so [b] is true, yet thousands of others were present, making [a] false.
These sentences are not saying the same thing in diﬀerent ways: they're saying different things.
The reason has to do with the fact that the clauses contain a quantifer (mny) and a
negative word (weren 't). The negative comes frst in [a] but the quantifer is frst in [b].
The relative order aﬀects the scope of the negative, as explained in Ch. 8, §5. This isn't
a fact about existential clauses: any clause in which a negative word precedes a quantifer tends to be interpreted with the negative including the quantifer in its scope.
Setting aside the special factor of scope, coresponding existential and non-existential clauses do have the same truth conditions, as illustrated in [3i] . And that is
also true for the other constructions considered. In the remainder of this chapter we
will set aside such special factors as scope.
2 Passive clauses
The frst information-packaging construction we consider is the passive
clause. Passive clauses contrast with active clauses in a system called voice, so we
consider that frst.
2. 1 The system of voice
A system of voice is one where the terms diﬀer as to how the SYNTACTIC
FUNCTIONS are aligned with SEMANTIC ROLES. Usually there are also formal
diﬀerences either associated with the verb (e.g. special inﬂection or auxiliaries) or
associated with the NPs (e.g. special case marking or prepositions).
The general terms active and passive are based on the semantic role of the subject in clauses expressing actions:
[5] In clauses describing some deliberate action, the subject is normally aligned
with the active participant (the actor) in the active voice, but with the passive
paricipant (the patient) in the passive voice.
In [ l ib], for example, the police refers to the actor and is subject; her son refers
to the patient, yet is subject in [ l ia].
There are also diﬀerences associated with the verb and one of the NPs: [ l ia] contains the passive auxiliary verb be, and the second NP is complement of the
preposition by.
Many clauses, of course, do not describe actions, but they can be assigned to the
active and passive categories on the basis of their syntactic likeness to clauses like
those in [ l i] :
§2.2 Diﬀerences between active and passive clauses 24 1
[6] ACTIVE VOICE
a. Everone saw the accident.
11 a. His colleagues dislike him.
PASSIVE VOICE
b. The accident was seen by everone.
b. He is disliked by his colleagues.
Seeing and disliking aren't actions, but the syntactic relation between the members
of these pairs is the same as that between [ 1 ib] and [ l ia], so they can be classifed as
active and passive pairs.
2.2 Diﬀerences between active and passive clauses
Examples like [ l ia], and the [b] examples in [6], illustrate the most
straightforward kind of passive clause. We'll look frst at how they diﬀer from their
active counterparts, and then extend the account to cover other passive constructions.
Structural diagrams for the examples in [6i] are shown in [7] . The syntactic
diﬀerences are summarised in [8] :
[7] a. Clause

[8] The subject of the active (everone) appears in the passive as complement of
the preposition by in a pp functioning as complement.
ii The direct object of the active appears as subject of the passive.
iii The passive has auxiliary be carrying the tense inﬂection and taking as
complement a subjectJess non-fnite clause with a head (seen) in past
participle form.
We use the term interalised complement to label the function of by everone, I
because when we replace an active clause by its corresponding passive, the active
I It is more usually referred to as the agent, but we're avoiding that term because it is also in widespread
use as the name of a semantic role, equivalent to 'actor' . As we just argued in discussing [6], the complement of by very often does not have that semantic role.
242 Chapter 1 5 Infonation packaging in the clause
clause subject appears interal to the passive VP, like interal complements (see
Ch. 4, § l ).
The auxiliary be of passive clauses takes on the inﬂectional properties of the verb
of the corresponding active, except that any person and number features are determined by AGREEMENT WITH THE PASSIVE SUBJECT (compare was above with were in
The accidents were seen by everone).
Voice and information packaging
The voice system provides diﬀerent ways of aligning the two major NPs in a clause
with the syntactic functions and hence of selecting their order of appearance.
Generally the subject comes frst in the clause and the object or interalised complement later. A major factor inﬂuencing the choice between these orders of presentation has to do with the familiarity status of the NPs. This involves the contrast
between old (familiar) and new (unfamiliar) infonation.
To illustrate the contrast between old and new, suppose a conversation began with
one of the following sentences:
[9] Te plumber says the dishwasher can 't be repaired, but I don 't think that's true.
11 Mv neighbour came over this moring; she asked me iI'd seen her cat.
In [i] the frst underlined sequence represents new infonation: I'm telling you
this, not treating it as something you are already familiar with. The word that is
interpreted as "the dishwasher can't be repaired", which is old - it's part of the
information that has already been introduced.
But infonation is to be understood in a broad sense that covers entities as well
as facts or propositions. My neighbour and her cat in [ii] refer to entities that
haven't been mentioned previously, so they represent new information. She is old
information, since it makes a second reference to my neighbour. Me and I count
as old because the deictic 1 st and 2nd person pronouns refer to participants in the
discourse who can always be regarded as familiar (if I'm telling you something,
then there are at least two people in the world that we can both agree that we
already know about: me and you).
In English there is a broad preference for packaging infonation so that SUBJECTS
REPRESENT OLD INFORMATION. It's only a preference, of course: there's no question
of a ban on subjects being new (that's obvious fom [9], where both the plumber and
my neighbour are new). But the preference is strong enough to be a clear inﬂuence on
the choice between equivalent active and passive clauses. Compare these:
[ 1 0] a. A dog attacked me in the park.
ii a. I bought a tie.
b. I was attacked by a dog in the park.
b. 'A tie was bought by me.
In [i], the active example [a] has a new-infonation subject, and [b], the passive,
has an old-infonation subject. The passive version will often be preferred in
such pairs (though [ia] is nonetheless perfectly grammatical and acceptable).
§2,4 Lexical restrictions 243
Things are diﬀerent in [ii], however. Suppose the context is one where I've just
said that I've been shopping: a tie is new, while I (or me) is old information. Here
only the active version will normally be acceptable.
Active is the default in the voice system. The use of actives is not restricted by
actual constraints relating to the combination of old and new information, but the
passive is. This is the generalisation that holds:
[ 1 1 ] In a passive clause it is not norally possible for the subject to be new when
the interalised complement is old.
There is far more to the choice between active and passive clauses than there is
space to discuss here. But all we want to point out is that while they normally have
the same core meaning, they are NOT FREELY INTERCHANGEABLE. They diﬀer in
how the information is presented, and one important factor in the choice between
them concerns the status of the two major NPs as representing old or new
information.
2.3 Short passives
In almost all cases the internalised complement is OPTIONAL. The
passive clauses with no interalised complement are called short passives; the ones
discussed so far are called long passives. Short passives are actually much more frequent than long passives. They have an important function: they enable us to LEAVE
OUT something that would be obligatory in the active, namely a main clause subject.
In [ 1 2] the active versions are not grammatical, but the passive ones are fne:
[ 1 2] ACTIVE VOICE
a. *Built the house in 1960.
ii a. *Damaged your car
III a. *Know little about the cause ofALS.
iv a. *Made mistakes.
PASSIVE VOICE
b. The house was built in 1960.
b. Your car was damaged.
b. Little is known about the cause ofALS.
b. Mistakes were made.
The passive versions enable us to avoid saying anything about
who built the house (we may have no idea who it was, or it may not be relevant);
which employee of ours accidentally damaged your car (there are liability
issues !);
who exactly is ignorant (nobody knows the cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis); or
who blundered (people don't always want to directly admit eror).
2.4 Lexical restrictions
Most transitive active clauses have passive counterparts, but not all. Some
exceptional verbs are (either generally or in certain uses) inadmissible in passives:
244 Chapter 1 5 Infonation packaging in the clause
[ 1 3] a . The town boasts a great beach. b. *A great beach is boasted by the town.
11 a. Ma lacks tact. b. *Tact is lacked by Ma.
III a. Jill has three wondeiul kids. b. * Three wondeil kids are had by Jilt.
IV a. Thejug holds three litres. b. * Three litres are held by the jug.
Boast and lck occur only in active clauses. Have occurs in passive constructions,
in its dynamic sense, as in She was happy tofnd there was both water and gas to be
had. Hol occurs in passives like It was held in place by duct tape, but not where it
means "contain".
2.5 Passives of ditransitive actives
Ditransitive clauses have two objects. Usually the passive of a ditransitive has a subject corresponding to the frst one, the indirect object. However, some
speakers (BrE rather than Am) have an alterative passive construction, illustrated
by [ 1 4iib], in which the subject corresponds to the direct object of the active ditransitive, but the passive of the construction with one object and a pp complement, as
in [ 1 4iiib], is widely preferred over it:
[ 1 4] a. The boss gave me the key.
ii a. The boss gave me the key.
III a. The boss gave the key to me.
2.6 Prepositional passives
b. I was given the ke by the boss.
b. %The key was given me by the boss.
b. The ke was given to me by the boss.
The subject of a passive may correspond to an object of a preposition
rather than of the verb (we cite short passives in [ 1 5] for greater naturalness; the [b]
examples are not exactly equivalent to the actives shown in [a]):
[ 1 5] a. People are looking into the matter.
ii a. They took advantage g us.
iii a. Someone has slept in this bed.
b. The matter is being looked into.
b. We were taken advantage q
b. This bed has been slept in.
In the [b] examples the doubly underlined preposition is stranded: no actual complement follows it, but an understood complement is retrievable from the subject.
Clauses of this kind are called prepositional passives. Two sUbtypes can be distinguished.
(a) Specified preposition
In [ 1 5i-ii] the preposition is specifed by the preceding verb or verbal idiom. Look
is a prepositional verb (see Ch. 7, §7.2) specifying into as preposition for the meaning "investigate", and the idiom take advantage specifes of This type of passive
has lexical restrictions on its availability: some verbs or verbal idioms penit the
§2.8 Bare passives 245
prepositional passive and some don't. Come across (meaning "encounter") and lose
patience with don't permit it:
[ 1 6] a. We came acrss some old letters.
II a. He lost patience with the children.
(b) Unspecified preposition
b. *Some old letters were come acrss.
b. *The children were lost patience with.
In [ 1 5iii] the preposition is not specifed; it has its ordinary meaning and in the
active can be replaced by other prepositions: Someone has slept under / on / near
this bed. Passives of this type are admissible only if the clause describes some signifcant EFFECT on the subject referent or some signifcant PROPERTY of it. Example
[ 1 5iiib] is acceptable because sleeping in a bed aﬀects it (that's why we change
the sheets). And Nauru can be driven arund in about hal an hour is acceptable because if you can drive around a country in two hours, it is very small, and
that's a signifcant property. On the other hand, * The bed was sat near is not acceptable: sitting near the bed wouldn't aﬀect it, and doesn't suggest any signifcant
property of it.
2.7 Get-passives
The passive clauses considered so far have the auxiliary be; we can call
them be-passives. There is also a passive with get instead of be:
[ 1 7] BE-PASSIVE GET-PASSIVE
a. Pat was bitten by a snake. b. Pat g bitten by a snake.
I I a . They weren 't charged until later b. They didn 't g charged until later
III a. She was elected mayor in 1 990. b. She g elected mayor in 1 990.
IV a. Several shots were heard. b. *Severl shots g heard.
Be is an auxiliary verb, but get isn't. In the negative and interogative, therefore, getpassives require the dummy auxiliary do, as seen in [iib].
The be-passive is stylistically neutral, but get-passives are a mark of informal
style. They are used for describing situations where the subject-referent is involved
in bringing the situation about, or where there is an adverse or benefcial eﬀect on the
subject-referent, as in [i-iii]. If no such factor is present, as with the inanimate subject in [iv], only the be-passive is acceptable.
2.8 Bare passives
Be-passives and get-passives have be and get as catenative verbs with
past-participial complements. Past-participial clauses also occur elsewhere with
passive interpretation, and we call these bare passives because they lack the be and
get markers. They can be either complements or modifers.
246 Chapter 1 5 Information packaging in the clause
(a) Bare passives as complement in complex catenatives
A few verbs that occur in the complex catenative construction - the one with an
'intervening NP' (Ch. 1 3, §4.3) - license bare passives as complement. They
include have, get (in a diﬀerent use from that of get-passives), order, and certain
sense verbs, such as see:
[ 1 8] We had the documents checked by a lawyer.
ii You should U yourselvaccinated a�ainst measles.
iii She orered the recors destryed.
iv He saw his son knocked down by a bus.
(b) Bare passives as modifier
As modifers, bare passives function in the structure of NPs:
[ 1 9] We want [a house built afer 1990].
ii [The complaint made by her lawyer] is being investigated.
These are comparable to relative clauses in be-passive form: a house which was
built afer 1 990; the complaint that was made by her lawyer.
2.9 Adjectival passives
Be can be followed by an adjective, and sometimes an adjective is
formed from the past participle of a verb. This case must be distinguished from the
be-passive. We can see this from the ambiguity of examples like [20], which can be
either:
[20] a. Her leg was brken. b. They were married.
As a passive clause, [a] describes an event, as in Her leg was brken in a hockey
accident. But it can also be a complex-intransitive clause - an intransitive
clause containing a predicative complement, as in Her leg was sore. In this interpretation, [a] describes a state resulting from an earlier event: She was using
crutches because her leg was broken. Here we say that brken (not the whole
clause) is an adjectival passive.
The be-passive reading of [b] also involves an event, as in They were married in
the College Chapel, but the complex-intransitive interpretation describes a state
resulting from a prior event, as in They were still happily married.
The key syntactic diﬀerence between the constructions is that THE ADJECTIVAL
PASSIVE CAN OCCUR WITH COMPLEX-INTRANSITIVE VERBS OTHER THAN BE:
[2 1 ] a . Her legfelt brken. b. They stayed married.
Here broken and married have only their adjectival, state interpretation.
Prescri ptive gra m m a r note
§3. 1 Subject extraposition 247
Some writers on scientifc topics appear to think that passives are required for objectivity
(The mice were anaesthetised rather than We anaesthetised the mice). At the other
extreme, some usage books and style guides insist that the passive is better avoided altogether. Both policies are excessive: passives are fully grammatical and acceptable, and a
passive is ofen the right stylistic choice.
Shor passives are sometimes criticised for a lack of frankness: they conceal the identity of the agent. In Mistakes were made we are not told who made the mistakes. But that
is not an objection to passive clauses; there are many ways of avoiding identifying the
responsible agent. For example, Mistaks occurred does not specify who made the mistakes either, but that is not a passive clause.
3 Extraposition
There are actually two extraposition constructions: subject extraposition
and interal complement extraposition. Subject extraposition (the one illustrated in
our original example [ l iia]) is more commonly encountered, so we'll deal with it frst.
3. 1 Subject extraposition
Clauses with a subordinate clause subject generally have variants with
the subordinate clause at the end and dummy it as subject:
[22] BASIC VERSION
a. That he was acguitted disturbs her
11 a. How she escaped remains a myster.
III a. To give up now would be a mistake.
VERSION WITH EXTRAPOSITION
b. / disturbs her that he was acguitted.
b. / remains a myster how she escaped.
b. / would be a mistake to give up now.
At least two distinctive properties of the subject outlined in Ch. 4, §2. l show that the
dummy it must be the subject: it ocurs before the VP, in the basic subject position, and
it occurs after the auxiliary when there is subject-auxiliary inversion (the closed interrogative countera of [ib], for example, is Does i disturb her that he was acquitted?).
We call the subordinate clause in the [b] version an extraposed subject, but that
doesn't mean it's a kind of subject; it's an element in extraposed position, outside
the VP, that CORRESPON DS to the subject of the basic version.
With minor exceptions, extraposition is admissible only with subordinate
clauses. Note, for example, the contrast between [22i] and [23]:
[23] a. His letters disturb her b. */ disturbs her his letters.
The subject in [a] is an NP and cannot be extraposed. The subordinate clauses concered are predominantly declarative and interrogative content clauses and infnitivals, as in [22i-iii] respectively. (Gerund-participials are also found extraposed under
sharply limited conditions; l 's been a pleasure talking to you is an example.)
248 Chapter 1 5 Infonation packaging in the clause
Extraposition: more frequent and less constrained than the alternative
In [22] we have labelled the version on the left as the syntactically basic one: the one
on the right has the extra pronoun it, and has a strcture not found in any canonical
clause. However, in pairs like these there are good reasons for regarding the version
with extraposition as the default, as far as infonation packaging is concered.
In the frst place, it is much more common. This is because subordinate clauses
tend to be heavier (longer and structurally more complex) than NPs, and there is in
general a preference for placing heavy material at the end of the matrix clause,
where it's easier to process.
Secondly, there are infonational constraints applying to the version without
extraposition but not to the one with extraposition, so extraposition is acceptable in
a wider range of contexts. The context for a non-extraposed subject must penit its
content to be taken as old infonation - familiar to the addressee, either through
previous mention or the addressee's current kowledge. Take the following two passages, from a science article on human skin:
[24] It is not easy to see, however what positive advantages may have been
responsiblefor human evolution toward nakedness, as compared with other
primates. [It has been suggested that lack ora heavy fr may have had some
adaptive value fr runnin� and huntin� in the open savannas], but this is
conjecturl.
ii In the eﬀort to enhance its attractiveness, men and women submit their skin
to systematic stretching, scrping, gouging, soaking and buring . . . To give
it a 'healthy ' tan, the skin is ritualistically exposed to excessive and injurious
doses ofsunlight and wind.
[That the skin survives these daily torents is a remarkable tribute to its
toughness. ]
The non-extraposed version of the bracketed clause in [i] would be completely
unacceptable in that context. The content of the underlined clause can't be construed as old. The writer is introducing a new idea that might represent a positive
advantage of nakedness: the content clause expresses the main infonational
content of the bracketed clause, and has to be extraposed.
In [ii] the frst paragraph lists a number of 'tonents' inﬂicted on the skin, and
then we get a non-extraposed subject clause (underlined) that does represent old
information: the reader of course knows already that our skin survives. What is
new in this sentence is that our skin's durability indicates how tough it is. That
means the constraint on using the non-extraposed version is satisfed. It doesn't
mean, though, that we MUST use the extraposed version. It would also be acceptable to use the default version, with extraposition: It is a remarkable tribute to its
toughness that the skin survives these daily torents.
3.2 Interal complement extraposition
Extraposition of an interal complement is found predominantly in
complex-transitive constructions, where it is just about obligatory:
§4 Existential clauses 249
[25] a. *lfnd that he uave up disappointing. b. Ifnd i disappointing that he uave up.
11 a. *She considers that I didn 't consult
her quite outrageous.
b. She considers i quite outrageous
that I didn 't consult her.
In [b] dummy it appears as object and the subordinate clause as extraposed
object.
The [a] versions are inadmissible by virtue of having the subordinate clause
located between the verb and another complement.
4 Existential clauses
The pronoun it is not the only pronoun used as a dummy in English. The
spelling there is today used for two diﬀerent words, one a locative rhyming with
dare and meaning "in or at that place" (as in Put it there), and the other a dummy
pronoun pronounced unstressed with a reduced vowel. The primary role of the
dummy there is to fll the syntactic subject position in clauses like the [b] examples
in [26], which are called existential clauses:
[26] BASIC VERSION
a. Some kes were near the safe.
ii a. A nurse was present.
EXISTENTIAL CLAUSE
b. There were some kes near the safe.
b. There was a nurse present.
There is the subject of the existential clauses in [26], just as it is subject in the extraposed subject construction, and similar arguments support this conclusion:
there occupies the basic subject position before the VP;
in subject-auxiliary inversion constructions it occurs after the auxiliary, as in
Was there a nurse present?
It is signifcant that there also occurs as subject in interrogative tags, as in:
[27] There was a nurse present, wasn 't there ?
Only pronouns are admissible in a tag like the one here, as we noted in Ch. 9, §2.3.
That means we not only know dummy there is a subject, we know it is a pronoun.
We will refer to some kes and a nurse in [26ib] and [26iib] as displaced subjects.
A displaced subject (like an extraposed subject) is not a kind of subject; it's the
phrase that corresponds to the subject of the syntactically more basic construction.2
Bare existentials
One common kind of existential clause contains just dummy there, the verb be, and
a displaced subject (possibly with optional adjuncts that have no bearing on the
2 There is an unusual kind of subject: it has no inherent number but takes on the number of the displaced subject - plural in [26ibl , with were as the verb, and singular in [iibl, with was. It's comparable to the relative pronouns which and who, which take on the number of their antecedent (the �
who were talking vs the W who � talking). Note, however, that in inforal style, especially in
present tense dec1aratives with reduced is, many speakers treat ther as always singular: they say
%There 's a few prblems instead of Ther are a few prblems. Prescriptivists disapprove, but the
usage is too well established to be treated as an occasional slip.
250 Chapter 15 Information packaging in the clause
structure or acceptability). We call these bare existentials. They have NO CORRESPONDING B ASIC V E RSION. The verb be normally requires an interal complement,
so the basic versions that would have corresponded to bare existentials are all
ungrammatical:
[28] BARE EXISTENTIAL CLAUSE
a. There is a god.
UNGRAMMATICAL BASIC VERSION
b. *A god is.
11 a. There are many species ofspiders.
III a. There has been no news ofthem.
IV a. There was a serious accident.
b. *Many species ofspiders are.
b. *No news of them has been.
b. *A serious accident was.
The general term 'existential' is based on examples like [ia] and [iia] in [28], which
are used to assert the existence of various things. But the existential construction
described in this section covers other uses than merely talking about existence.
Extended existentials
There are also extended existentials, which contain an additional element, the extension, within the VP. Some examples are given in [29], with the extension underlined.
[29] LOCATIVE
11 TEMPORAL
iii PREDICATIVE ADJECTIVE
iv HOLLOW INFINITIVAL
There 's a snake in the grass.
There 's another meeting this aferoon.
There are still some seats available.
There is poor old Albert to consider.
Locative complements as in [i] are particularly common extensions.
Temporal extensions occur with displaced subjects that denote events, e.g.
another meeting in [ii].
. Predicative complement extensions are restricted to a range of adjectives denoting temporary states as in [iii], e.g. absent, available, missing, present, vacant,
and wrong (as in There 's something wrong). Most adjectives don't occur as
extensions like this: a sentence like Some politicians are honest doesn't have a
corresponding bare existential * There are some politicians honest.
Intival extensions a hollow clauses in the sense of Ch. 1 3, §2.4: they have a gap
in interal complement fnction, usually object, as in [iv], where ther is a missing
object for consider: we interpret [iv] as being about consideration for poor old Alber.
Constraints on the use of basic and existential constructions
We showed in [28] that bare existential clauses don't have non-existential counterparts. The same is true of existentials extended by a hollow infnitival: [29iv] cannot
be reformulated as *Poor old Albert is to consider. With other kinds of extended
existential we cannot make a general statement about either the existential or the
non-existential version being the default: there are constraints applying to both versions. We' ll brieﬂy mention two that apply to both bare and extended existentials.
(a) Indefnite NPs
With indefnite NPs there is a PREFERENCE FOR THE E XISTENTIAL CONSTRUCTION.
In fact sometimes only the existential is acceptable:
§5 The it-cleft construction 25 1
[30] i a. A policeman is here. b. There 's a policeman here.
ii a. *Two holes were in my sock. b. There were two holes in my sock.
In [i] both versions are possible, but the second is considerably more likely.
In [ii] the basic version is unacceptable (this is generally the case with NPs
denoting abstract entities).
(b) Defnite NPs
With defnite NPs the preference is reversed, with the NON-EXISTENTIAL MORE
LIKELY:
[3 1 ] a. Your mother is here. b. ·'There 's your mother here.
Displaced subjects are presented as information that is new to the addressee.
Defnite NPs tend to be associated with old information, but they don't have to be.
Consider this example:
[32] A:
B :
Who could we get to give a lecture on intonation ?
Well, [there 's Sue lones, ] I suppose.
The underlined defnite NP represents new information - the name is oﬀered as a
suggestion.
Presentationals
A construction similar to the existential, known as the presentational clause, has
dummy there as subject not of be but of an intransitive verb such as appear, emerge,
folow, or remain :
[33] a. Many prblems remain. b. There remain many prblems.
5 The it-cleft construction
We tur now to a number of information-packaging constructions not
illustrated in the introduction to the chapter, beginning with the it-clef construction. This generally provides more than one variant of the corresponding non-cleft
clause - at least one for each NP, in fact:
[34] NON-CLEFT TT-CLEFT

To form an it-cleft clause from a syntactically more basic non-cleft we divide it into
two parts - hence the 'clef' component of the name. One par (marked here by double underlining) is foregrounded, while the other (single underlining) is
backgrounded. A considerable range of elements can be selected as the foregrounded element: for example, in [b] it is the subject, in [c] the object, in [d] the
complement of the preposition to.
252 Chapter 15 Information packaging in the clause
Syntactic structure of the it-clef
The foregrounded element functions as complement to be. The subject is invariably
it, a meaningless dummy pronoun. The backgrounded part is expressed as a relative
clause, with the foregrounded element as antecedent for the relativised element,
here who (see Ch. 1 1 , § 1). So the structure of [b] is as follows:
[35] Clause
Head: Dependent:
Clause Clauserel
� �
Subject: Predicate: Subject: Predicate:
NP VP NP VP
� �
Predicator: PredComp: Predicator: Object: Comp:
V NP V NP PP
I I I I 6
it was Sue who introduced Jim to Pat
The relative clause is of the integrated type (cf. Ch. 1 1 , §2), but it's not a dependent of Sue: the words Sue who intrduced Jim to Pat do not form a syntactic constituent. In an ordinary integrated relative like They were [eople who needed
help], the bracketed sequence people who needed help IS a constituent, an NP.
This means there may be ambiguity between it-clefts and ordinary integrated
relatives:
[36] It was the song that impressed them.
As an it-cleft, this means The song impressed them, and the it is a dummy. It
might be used to answer the question What impressed the record company ?
As a non-cleft, you can imagine [36] as an answer to Why did the choose that
song to release as a single ? Here it is an ordinary pronoun referring to the song,
and the song that impressed them does form a constituent.
The foregrounded element
In our initial example, [34b-d], the foregrounded element was an NP whose function in the corresponding non-cleft clause was subject, object, and complement of a
preposition. There are many other possibilities, a few of which are illustrated in [37]
(where the relative clauses are of the non-wh type):
[37] NON-CLEF
a. They think Y should leave.
ii a. Sue intrduced Jim to Pat.
iii a. He signed the bill with this pen.
iv a. She doesn 't ofen miss a class.
v a. I resigned to avoid beinu fred.
§5 The it-clef construction 253
IT-CLEF
b. It's Y the think should leave.
b. It was to Pat that Sue intrduced Jim.
b. It was with this pen that he signed the bill.
b. It isn 't ofen that she misses a class.
b. It was to avoid beinu fred that I resigned.
In [ia] you is subject of an embedded content clause (ou should leave is complement of think).
In [iia] to Pat is a pp in complement function; note that [iib] is a variant of [34d],
more formal in style, avoiding the stranded preposition; see Ch. 7, §5.
The underlined elements in the other [a] examples - a PP, an adverb, and a nonfnite clause respectively - are all adjuncts of various kinds.
This wide range of possibilities further distinguishes this type of relative clause
from the prototypical type that modifes a noun. For example, that he signed the bill
in [iiib] couldn't occur as modifer to pen: we couldn't say * This is [the pen that he
signed the bill] (we'd need to include the preposition: This is [the pen that he signed
the bill with]).
Backgrounded element as presupposition
The eﬀect of backgrounding is to present the information in question as a presupposition - information that is taken for granted, its truth not being at issue. In [37ib]
I take it for granted that they think someone should leave, and assert that you're the
one they have in mind. And in [37iib] it is not at issue whether Sue introduced Jim
to someone: the question is who.
Presuppositions are normally not aﬀected when we negate the containing
construction, and this is the source of a sharp diﬀerence between clefts and their
non-cleft counterparts:
[38] a. Sue didn 't intrduce Jim to Pat. b. It wasn 't to Pat that Sue intrduced Jim.
The non-clef [a] simply denies that Sue introduced Jim to Pat: it doesn't convey
that she introduced Jim to someone else. The cleft [b] is diﬀerent: the presupposition that Sue introduced Jim to someone stands, and what's denied is that Pat was
that person.
In likely uses of all the examples considered so far, the presupposition will be old
information, introduced into the prior discourse or inferable from it. The natural
context for [37iib] and [38b], for example, is one where Sue is introducing Jim
to someone who has already been mentioned. But this is not a necessary feature of
it-clefts. The backgrounded material may introduce new information into the
discourse. This happens in [39] :
[39] The Indians were helpful in many ways. [It was they who taught the settlers
how to plant and harvest crps successfllY in the New World. ]
254 Chapter 1 5 Information packaging in the clause
6 Pseudo-clefts
The pseudo-cleft is quite similar to the it-clef in some ways: again we
have a division between foregrounded and backgrounded elements, with the backgrounded material representing presupposed information. But in the case of pseudocleft, the backgrounded material is placed in a fused relative construction:
[40] NON-CLEFT PSEUDO-CLEFT
a. We need more time. b. What we need is more time.
n a. He claims he was insulted. b. What he claims is that he was insulted.
III a. I'll postpone the meeting. b. What I'll do is gostgone the meeting.
Again we use single underlining for the backgrounded element and double underlining for the foregrounded one. The backgrounded material forms a fused relative construction in the sense explained in Ch. 1 1 , §4 (compare what we need with
the non-fused relative that which we need). In rib] , for example, I take it for
granted that we need something and assert that that something is more time. As
before, the presupposition normally survives negation: if I say What we need is
not more time, it 's some fresh ideas, I'm still taking it for granted that we need
something.
The foregrounded element
There is only partial overlap between the elements that can be foregounded in the
pseudo-cleft and those that can be in the it-cleft. Thus we could have an it-cleft
instead of [40ib] (It 's more time that we need), but not the others (*It is that he
was insulted that he claims, *It 's postpone the meeting that I 'll do). Pseudoclefts accept subordinate clauses as foregrounded element much more readily
than it-clefts do.
Who is not normally found in fused relatives in present-day usage, so pseudo-clefts
don't allow foregrounding of personal NPs: we don't fnd * Who introduced Jim to
Pat was Sue. Instead we use an it-cleft or a non-fused relative construction such as
The one who intrduced Jim to Pat was Sue.
Pseudo-clefts and the specifying be construction
The pseudo-cleft is really just a particular case ofthe specifying be construction discussed in Ch. 4, §4.3. As usual, subject and complement can be reversed, giving
More time is what we need, and so on.
Note also that the pseudo-cleft is less systematically related to non-clefts than the
it-cleft. There are cases of pseudo-clefts with no non-clef counterparts:
[4 1 ] PSEUDO-CLEFT
a. What 1 object to is that he lied.
ii a. What 1 like about her is that she
always means what she says.
NON-CLEFT
b. *1 object to that he lied.
b. *1 like about her that she
always means what she says.
7 Dislocation
§7 Dislocation 255
The prototypical dislocation construction has an extra NP located to the
left or right of the main part of the clause, consisting of subject and predicate, which
we call the nucleus. The extra NP serves as antecedent for a personal pronoun
within the nucleus:
[42] NON-DISLOCATED CLAUSE
a. One ofmy cousins has triplets.
11 a. I think the man next door's
car was stolen.
III a. Her father can be verjudgemental.
DISLOCATED CLAUSE
b. One ofmy cousins, she has triplets.
b. The man next door, I think his car
was stolen.
b. He can be verjudgemental, her fther.
Examples [ib/iib] illustrate left dislocation (the NP in question is positioned to the
left of the clause nucleus), while [iiib] has right dislocation. Both are characteristic
of relatively informal style, such as conversation, especially oral personal narrative.
The pronoun may be the subject within the nucleus, as in [ib] and [iiib]. It can
also be direct or indirect object, complement of a preposition, and so on. In [iib] it
is subject-determiner within the subject of an embedded clause.
Dislocated constructions can be easier to understand than their basic counterpart.
Left dislocation may put a complex NP early in the sentence, replacing it with a
pronoun in the nucleus, so the nucleus is structurally simpler. (Note that in
[42iib] the subject-determiner in the dislocated version is simply his, whereas in
[42iia] it is the more complex genitive the man next door 's.)
Right dislocation often has an NP that clarifes the reference of the pronoun.
(Imagine that [42iiib] was uttered following Tom didn 't dare tell herfather: the
NP herfather would make clear that he means her father, not Tom.)
Extraposition is not right dislocation
The extraposition construction discussed in §3 above looks superfcially like a
special case of right dislocation, but in fact it isn't. The differences are as
follows:
In dislocation the NP placed to the left or right of the nucleus is set apart prosodically from the rest of the clause, but extraposition clauses usually have unbroken
intonation.
The it of extraposition is a dummy, not a referential pronoun like the he of
[42iiib] . Thus the extraposed clause doesn't 'clarify the reference' of it: the it has
no reference. If the extraposed clause were omitted, the speaker's intended meaning would normally be lost. The right dislocation [42iiib], by contrast, would
make sense even without the fnal NP.
Extraposition is stylistically quite neutral, whereas right dislocation, as noted
above, belongs mainly to informal style.
256 Chapter 1 5 Information packaging in the clause
8 Prposing and postposing
All the information-packaging constructions considered so far in this
chapter diﬀer structurally from their syntactically more elementary counterpart in a
way which involves one or more functions:
� a passive clause has a diﬀerent subject from the corresponding active;
s a cleft clause has as complement of be a foregrounded element that can have a
range of functions within the non-cleft counterpart;
f extraposition and existentials have dummy subjects;
4 dislocation involves pronouns substituting for dislocated NPs.
In this section we review some constructions where there are no such changes to the
syntactic functions in the clause; rather, constituents with given functions appear in
an unexpected position in the sentence. We look in tur at preposing, postposing
and two knds of inversion.
[43] PREPOSING
ii POSTPOSING
iii INVERSION
Some ofhem he hadn 'f even read.
I understood eventually the reason for their antagonism.
{ b. a. Never In the drwer had lfelt was a so alone. gun. [subject-dependent [subject-auxiliary in invers version ion] ]
; Preposing involves putting an element before the subject of a clause when its
basic position would be after the verb.
1 Postposing involves putting an element at or near the end of the clause rather
than in the earlier position that would be its default place.
• In [iiia] there is inversion of subject and auxiliary verb following preposed
never.
, The inversion in [iiib] combines preposing (of a PP) and postposing (of the
subject NP).
(a) Preposing
The contrast between basic order and preposing is seen in such pairs as the following:
[44] BASIC ORDER
a. I wasn 't allowed to watch T when
I was at school.
ii a. I said he could have the others.
iii a. They made costume jeweller.
iv a. Mr Brown is not humble.
v a. I said I 'd payfor it, [and I will
Day for itl.
PREPOSING
b. When I was at school I wasn 'f
allowed to watch T
b. The others I said he could have.
b. Costume jeweller, the made.
b. Humble, Mr Brwn is not.
b. I said I'd payfor it, [and
pay fr it I will].
The preposed element in [ib] is an adjunct. Preposing of adjuncts occurs relatively
freely. In the other examples it is a complement that is preposed. This is more constrained; a preposed complement serves as a link to the preceding discourse, and
must be closely related to information previously introduced into the discourse:
§8 Preposing and postposing 257
In [iib], the others refers to a subset of some set of things already mentioned.
The original preceding context for [iiib] was this: So when I lef school I took
some of those things to show to a jeweller manufacturer and askedfor a job.
There is previous mention ofjewellery, and the preposed element denotes a knd
ofjewellery.
The original full version of [ivb] was this: His humilit must have been invented
by the adman, for humble, Mr Brwn is not. So humble relates to the earlier mention of humility.
In [vb] we see a special case of complement preposing that occurs with complements of auxiliary verbs and typically serves to emphasise the truth of what is
being asserted.
(b) Postposing
Further examples of postposing are given in [45], along with their default order
counterpas:
[45] BASIC ORDER
a. The brught an extrordinarily
lavish lunch with them.
II a. A man whom I'd never seen before
came in.
POSTPOSING
b. They brught with them an
extrordinarily lavish lunch.
b. A man came in whom I'd never
seen befre.
The postposed element is an object in [ib] (as in [43ii]), and a dependent (modifer)
within the subject NP in [iib] .
The major factor leading to the choice of a postposing construction is relative
weight. Weight of constituents is primarily a matter of length and complexity. In
[45i] the object NP is quite heavy in comparison with the pp complement with them,
and for this reason can readily be put at the end ofthe clause instead of in the default
object position immediately after the verb. Note two things:
If the object were simply lunch then the basic order would normally be required.
If we lengthened it to something like an extrordinarily lavish lunch that their
daughter had helped them prepare, then postposing would be more or less
obligatory.
A postposed element occurs in a position that tends to receive greater phonological prominence and where complex material is easier to process. Extraposition is
syntactically distinct from postposing in that it introduces the dummy pronoun it
into the structure, but it shares with postposing the eﬀect of positioning heavy material (a subordinate clause) at the end of the matrix clause.
(c) Subject-auxiliar inversion
[46] BASIC ORDER
a. The pain was so bad that Ifainted.
II a. I realised my mistake only later.
SUBJECT-AUXILIARY INVERSION
b. So bad was thepain that Ifainted.
b. Only later did I realise my mistake.
258 Chapter 15 Information packaging in the clause
This type of inversion, as the name implies, requires the presence of an auxiliary
verb. If there is no auxiliary in the basic order version, then dummy do is inserted,
as in [iib] (cf. Ch. 3, §3. 1).
Subject-auxiliary inversion is found in a considerable range of constructions,
some of which have nothing to do with information packaging; most obvious
among the latter is the closed interrogative construction, with inversion distinguishing interogative Is it ready ?, say, from declarative It is ready (Ch. 9, §2. 1 ). Here,
though, we're concered with subject-auxiliary inversion as an accompaniment of
preposing. In the examples given, subject-auxiliary inversion is triggered by the
preposing of so bad and only later. The main elements that trigger inversion like this
include:
negatives, as in [43iiia] ;
expressions containing so or only, as in [46] - or Sue is going, and so am [.
similar forms with such: Such a fuss did ! make that we abandoned the idea.
(d) Subject-dependent inversion
[47] BASIC ORDER
i a. A bowl offuit was on her desk.
SUBJECT-DEPENDENT INVERSION
b. On her desk was a bowl offuit.
ii a. The view fom the top is even better. b. Even better is the view fom the top.
This time the elements inverted are the subject and another dependent of the verb.
The latter is usually a complement - most commonly a locative or an adjectival
predicative complement, as in [47]. The verb is most often be, but other verbs of relatively little informational content, such as appear, le, sit, etc., are also found.
This type of inversion puts the subject in fnal position, where it typically
receives greater phonological prominence than in its basic position. It very often
represents new information, and we will not normally have inversion if the subject is old and the dependent new. Compare [a] and [b] in [48], where the version
with old + new is completely natural while the one with new + old is highly
unnatural:
[48] OLD NEW
a
·1 In the drawer I was I Q.l·1
9 Reduction
NEW OLD
b
· 1 ?In a drawerI was I �· I
In this fnal section of the chapter we review summarily a number of constctions where a constituent representing old information is reduced to a pronoun or
similar form or else omitted altogether. We use ellipsis for the omission of old information and introduce the modem ter pr-form in place of 'pronoun or similar for' :
[49] i I'd like to go with you but I can 't _.
ii Myfather said he would help you.
[reduction by ellipsis]
[reduction by pro-for]
9. 1 Reduction of NPs 259
In [i] the VP can 't is understood as "can't go with you", the missing infnitival
complement being recoverable from the preceding clause. We can generalise the
concepts of anaphora and antecedent to cover such cases of ellipsis (cf. Ch. 5,
§8. 1): the ellipted complement is thus anaphorically related to the antecedent go
with you in the frst clause.
In the salient interpretation of [ii] it is a matter of my father helping you: the
pronoun he is anaphoric to the antecedent myfather.
Pro-form VS pronoun
The reason why we need the term 'pro-form' as well as 'pronoun' can be seen from
such examples as the following:
[50] PRONOUN? PRO-FORM?
i A: Was she arrested? B : I'm afrid so.
ii It's time to go. Who brke the vase ?
No
Yes
Yes
No
In [i], so is a pro-form (interpreted anaphorically as "she was arrested"), but it
isn't a pronoun. It couldn't be: afraid takes a clause as complement (I'm afrid
she was arrested) but not any kind of NP (*I'm afrid herfate; *I'm afraid it).
In [ii], it and who are pronouns: they head NPs in subject position and do not
permit determiners. But they are not pro-forms: they do not represent old information retrievable in full from the context.
9. 1 Reduction of NPs
There are three main types of reduction to consider under this heading.
(a) Personal pronouns
This is the central case illustrated in [49ii] ; it was discussed in Ch. 5, §8. 1 and needs
no further commentary here.
(b) The pro-forms one and other
[5 1 ] She lef us six pears; this one is riper than the others / the other ones.
These forms always have a count interpretation, and unlike pronouns they have an
antecedent that is not a full NP: in this example it is pears, not six pears. Syntactically they are common nouns, not pronouns.
They diﬀer from pronouns in that they take determiners, such as this and the
in [5 1 ] .
They are like prototypical common nouns i n having an inﬂectional contrast
between singular one/other and plural ones/others.
(c) The fused head construction
What we have called the simple and implicit partitive uses of the fused head
construction (Ch. 5, §7. 1 ) are generally interpreted anaphorically:
260 Chapter 1 5 Information packaging in the clause
[52] i I need some ink, but I can 't fnd m.
ii I had put some mangoes on the table and as usual Ma took the larest.
The fused determiner-head any is interpreted anaphorically as "any ink" and the
fused modifer-head largest as "largest of them", i.e., "largest of the mangoes".
9.2 Reduction of clauses, VPs and other phrases
(a) Clause reducion
[53] He says fill informed the press, but that can 't be true.
ii She may change her mind, but I doubt f.
III I'm not sure I'llfnish today, but I hope so.
IV She 's coming rund to see us, but she didn 't say when _.
.� NPs such as that, this and it can have clauses rather than NPs as antecedent, as
in [i-ii].
, So can serve as a kind of 'pro-clause' , as in [iii] and [50i] above. It functions
mainly as interal complement to such verbs as beleve, think, seem (as in It
seems so), etc.
In [iv] we see ellipsis of everything but the initial phrase of an interrogative
content clause.
(b) VP reducion
[54] He suggested we put the house on the market, but I don 't want to do that yet.
11 She drove us to the station, but she did so reluctantly.
iii Ed isn 't ready, but I am _. Come iyou can _. I saw it and Pat did _ too.
iv You can come with us iyou want to _.
v I don 't prmise to get itfnished today, but I'll tr _.
vi They asked me who infored the press, but I don 't know _.
" The NPs this, that and it can combine with the lexical verbdo to form a 'pro-YP' ;
do that in [i] is interpreted anaphorically as "put the house on the market".
So combines with do in a similar way: did so in [ii] is understood as "drove us to
the station".
The examples in [iii] involve the ellipsis of the complement of an auxiliary verb.
This is another construction where the dummy auxiliary verb do is used if there
would not otherwise be an auxiliary verb present, as in the third example ("Pat
saw it toO").3
Quite similar is the ellipsis of a YP following the infnitival marker to, as in [iv].
A relatively small number of lexical catenative verbs allow ellipsis of their nonfnite complement: tr in [v] is understood as "try to get it fnished today".
Similarly, some verbs, such as know in [vi], permit ellipsis of a content clause
complement: "I don't know who informed the press".
3 A further construction of this kind is the one where stress is used to emphasise that a clause is positive, not negative: I HAVE told you. Dummy do is needed if there is no other auxiliary to carry the
stress: I DID tell you (contrasting with non-emphatic I told you).
Exercises 26 1
(c) Pro-forms for predicative complements and locative PPs
[55] i She was extremely bright I an excellent manager or at least she seemed so.
ii He was bor in Boston and lived there all his lie.
" So has other anaphoric uses than those mentioned above; in paricular, it can fnction as predicative complement, allowing a variety of categories of antecedent,
such as the AdjP extremely bright or the NP an excellent manager in [i].
The preposition there is comonly used anaphorically with a locative expression
as antecedent, as in [ii]. It can also be used deictically, as in Justput it over there.

CHAPTER 8 Deixis and anaphora


The phenomenon of deixis involves the use of a word or phrase whose interpretation is determined through considerations of the physical properties in the situation of utterance, from the perspective of the speaker or the addressee who are engaged in the act of communication. When the need to make further structural distinctions is in order, a deictic consisting of one single word is referred to as a “deictic term,” while a larger deictic built around a deictic term is referred to as a “deictic expression.”


Anaphora as a phenomenon is defined as a co-referential relationship between an anaphor and its antecedent. Such a relation can be established either within a clause or beyond, resulting in unification or partial overlap in reference. For ease of exposition, an anaphor consisting of one single word is given the label “anaphoric term,” while a larger one built around an anaphoric term is labeled “anaphoric expression.”


Deictic and anaphoric uses of pronouns 
Most pronouns are characteristically used either deictically or anaphorically. 


Deictic uses of pronouns 
The term deixis applies to the use of expressions in which the meaning can be traced directly to features of the act of utterance - when and where it takes place, and who is involved as speaker and as addressee. In their primary meaning, for example, now and here are used deictically to refer respectively to the time and place of the utter­ance. Similarly, this country is likely to be interpreted deictically as the country in which the utterance takes place. Several of the pronouns are predominantly used deictically, with I and we referring to the speaker and a group including the speaker, you to the addressee(s) or a set including the addressee(s). 


Anaphoric uses of pronouns 
The term anaphora applies to the use of expressions in which the meaning is derived from another expression in the surrounding linguistic material. That other expression is called the antecedent. 


Jill said she was unavailable. 
The victim's daughter didn't come to the meeting. Liz said she was unavailable. 
When I last saw her, Jill seemed to be extremely busy. 


The antecedent usually precedes the pronoun, but under certain conditions it can follow the pronoun. The traditional term 'pronoun' suggests it serves for or on behalf of a noun. This is based on the anaphoric use, but it unfortunately suggests that a pronoun is used in place of a noun, which is not correct. An anaphoric pronoun stands in place of a full noun phrase. For  example, she could be replaced by  the  antecedent NP (Liz  said the  victim's daughter was unavailable), but  not  by  the  head noun (*Liz said daughter was unavailable). 


Not only pronouns that are used anaphorically. 
I warned Jack about that, but the fool wouldn't  listen.
